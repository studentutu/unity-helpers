/**
 * The two analyzer DLLs this package ships are committed under `Runtime/Analyzers`, and the
 * `WallstopProto Generator` workflow compares them byte-for-byte against a fresh
 * `dotnet build -c Release` of the sources beside them.
 *
 * Nothing local did. Editing an analyzer source and forgetting the rebuild was therefore a ~10
 * minute round trip through that workflow to discover, and CSharpier reformatting the source is
 * enough to trigger it -- which is exactly how session 221 hit it, from a mechanical
 * comparison-direction sweep that touched one analyzer file.
 *
 * This runs the workflow's comparison, not an approximation of it: each project is built with
 * `AnalyzerPayloadOutputDir` redirected at a scratch directory, and the bytes it produces are
 * compared against the committed ones. An earlier version instead built INTO the tree and diffed
 * the directory against itself before and after, which could not fail in three separate ways
 * (#558): a renamed `Runtime/Analyzers` made both sides an empty map, a deleted DLL contributed no
 * key to the `after` side it was filtered from, and a `.csproj` edit that stopped the copy made the
 * two sides identical by construction -- the exact scenario the gate exists for, inverted.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = shipped DLLs match their sources (or were refreshed by --fix), 1 = stale.
