// Structural guard for the Unity credential leak.
//
// Unity writes its license identity into unity.log and configure.log while it activates. GitHub
// masks a registered secret in the rendered job log, but it never rewrites the bytes of an uploaded
// artifact, so uploading a Unity output directory publishes the serial to anyone who can download
// the artifact.
//
// Scrubbing the seven known uploads does not close the failure mode, because the next job that
// uploads a Unity directory reopens it. This asserts the invariant instead: every upload of a
// Unity-log-bearing path is preceded, in the same job, by a redaction step that covers that path.
//
// The workflows are read with a small line scanner rather than a YAML library. This repository
// installs no YAML parser, and scripts/validate-build-lock-action-inputs.js already reads workflow
// and action files the same way. The scanner is held honest by the parser self-tests below: it must
// find the known jobs, steps and uploads, so a scanner that silently stops matching fails loudly
// instead of reporting a clean repository.
