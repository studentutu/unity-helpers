# Skill: High-Performance C

<!-- trigger: performance, allocation, gc, memory, optimize | ALL code - zero allocation patterns | Core -->

**Trigger**: When implementing ANY new feature, fixing bugs, or writing editor tooling. This applies to ALL code in this repository.

---

## Core Philosophy

**Every code path should be allocation-free in steady state.** This includes:

- Runtime gameplay code
- Editor tooling and inspectors (called every frame when visible)
- Bug fixes (must not regress performance)
- Test utilities (may run thousands of iterations)

### Why Zero-Allocation Matters in Unity

Unity's Boehm garbage collector scans the entire heap on every collection, causes frame stutters, and never compacts memory. At 60 FPS with 1KB/frame = **3.6 MB/minute** of garbage, triggering frequent GC pauses.

See [gc-architecture-unity](./gc-architecture-unity.md) for detailed GC architecture information.

**Never duplicate code - build abstractions.** When you see repetitive patterns:

- Extract to lightweight, reusable abstractions
- Prefer `readonly struct` or `static` methods for zero allocation
- Apply SOLID principles - single responsibility, open/closed extension
- Use composition to build complex behavior from simple pieces

---

## Abstraction Guidelines

### When to Abstract

- **Two or more occurrences** - If you write similar code twice, extract it
- **Complex logic** - Encapsulate non-obvious algorithms behind clear interfaces
- **Cross-cutting concerns** - Logging, caching, validation patterns

### How to Abstract (Zero Allocation)

```csharp
// ✅ Value-type abstraction - no heap allocation
public readonly struct ValidationResult
{
    public readonly bool IsValid;
    public readonly string ErrorMessage;
    private readonly int _hash;

    public ValidationResult(bool isValid, string errorMessage = null)
    {
        IsValid = isValid;
        ErrorMessage = errorMessage;
        _hash = Objects.HashCode(isValid, errorMessage);
    }
}

// ✅ Static utility methods - no allocation
public static class CollectionExtensions
{
    public static bool TryGetFirst<T>(this IList<T> list, out T result)
    {
        if (list.Count > 0)
        {
            result = list[0];
            return true;
        }
        result = default;
        return false;
    }
}

// ✅ Generic constraint-based abstraction
public static void ProcessAll<T>(IList<T> items) where T : IProcessable
{
    for (int i = 0; i < items.Count; i++)
    {
        items[i].Process();
    }
}
```

### Abstraction Anti-Patterns

```csharp
// ❌ Class when struct suffices - unnecessary allocation
public class ValidationResult { }

// ❌ Closure-capturing delegate factory
public Func<T> CreateGetter<T>(T value) => () => value;  // Allocates!

// ❌ Over-abstraction - adds complexity without value
public interface IStringProvider { string GetString(); }
public class ConstantStringProvider : IStringProvider { ... }  // Just use the string!
```

---

## Aggressive Inlining for Hot Paths

Mark frequently-called small methods:

```csharp
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
public override int GetHashCode() => _hash;

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
public bool Equals(FastVector2Int other)
{
    return _hash == other._hash && x == other.x && y == other.y;
}

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]
public static bool operator ==(FastVector2Int lhs, FastVector2Int rhs)
{
    return lhs.Equals(rhs);
}
```

---

## String Building Best Practices

String operations are a common source of allocations. Choose the right approach based on context:

| Context                   | Recommended Approach        | Example                       |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Hot paths (Update, loops) | `StringBuilder` via pooling | `Buffers.StringBuilder.Get()` |
| Two strings               | Direct `+` is fine          | `firstName + lastName`        |
| 3+ parts, non-hot path    | String interpolation        | `$"{name}: {value}"`          |
| Building in loops         | **Always** `StringBuilder`  | See below                     |
| Format with many args     | `StringBuilder`             | Avoids `params` allocation    |

```csharp
// ❌ BAD: Concatenation in loop - O(n^2) allocations!
string result = "";
for (int i = 0; i < items.Count; i++)
{
    result += items[i].Name;  // New string each iteration!
}

// ✅ GOOD: StringBuilder with pooling - zero allocation
using var lease = Buffers.StringBuilder.Get(out StringBuilder sb);
for (int i = 0; i < items.Count; i++)
{
    sb.Append(items[i].Name);
}
string result = sb.ToString();
```

---

## Editor Tooling Requirements

Editor code runs every frame when inspectors are visible. Apply ALL performance patterns:

```csharp
// ❌ Allocates every OnGUI call
public override void OnInspectorGUI()
{
    List<string> options = GetOptions().ToList();  // Allocation!
    int selected = EditorGUILayout.Popup("Option", current, options.ToArray());  // More allocations!
}

// ✅ Cache everything, pool temporaries
private static readonly GUIContent TitleContent = new GUIContent("Option");
private string[] _cachedOptions;
private int _cachedOptionsHash;

public override void OnInspectorGUI()
{
    int currentHash = ComputeOptionsHash();
    if (_cachedOptions == null || _cachedOptionsHash != currentHash)
    {
        using var lease = Buffers<string>.List.Get(out List<string> options);
        GetOptions(options);
        _cachedOptions = options.ToArray();  // Only allocate when data changes
        _cachedOptionsHash = currentHash;
    }

    int selected = EditorGUILayout.Popup(TitleContent, current, _cachedOptions);
}
```

**Cache GUIContent, GUIStyle, and computed values:**

```csharp
private static readonly GUIContent Label = new GUIContent("Label", "Tooltip");
private static readonly GUIStyle BoxStyle = new GUIStyle("box");
private static readonly Color HighlightColor = new Color(0.3f, 0.6f, 1f);
```

## LINQ Forbidden Patterns

### LINQ vs Native Collection Methods (CRITICAL DISTINCTION)

**NOT all methods ending in common names are LINQ.** This is a critical distinction:

| Method                            | Is LINQ? | Class                    | Allocates?                | Action                                 |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `list.ToArray()`                  | NO       | `List<T>`                | Yes (result only)         | **KEEP** - uses optimized `Array.Copy` |
| `list.ToList()`                   | NO       | `List<T>` (copy)         | Yes (result only)         | **KEEP** - optimized copy constructor  |
| `enumerable.ToArray()`            | YES      | `System.Linq.Enumerable` | Yes + iterator            | **ELIMINATE** - allocates iterator     |
| `enumerable.ToList()`             | YES      | `System.Linq.Enumerable` | Yes + iterator            | **ELIMINATE** - allocates iterator     |
| `.Where()`, `.Select()`, `.Any()` | YES      | `System.Linq.Enumerable` | Yes (iterator + delegate) | **ELIMINATE**                          |
| `.First()`, `.FirstOrDefault()`   | YES      | `System.Linq.Enumerable` | Yes (iterator)            | **ELIMINATE**                          |
| `.ToDictionary()`, `.ToHashSet()` | YES      | `System.Linq.Enumerable` | Yes + iterator            | **ELIMINATE**                          |
| `.OrderBy()`, `.GroupBy()`        | YES      | `System.Linq.Enumerable` | Yes (multiple)            | **ELIMINATE**                          |

**Rule of thumb:** If the source type is `List<T>`, `T[]`, `Dictionary<K,V>`, or other concrete collection, check if the method is native to that type. If the source is `IEnumerable<T>` or the result of a LINQ operation, it's a LINQ extension method.

### Forbidden Hot Path Patterns

| Pattern                              | Problem                         | Alternative                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| LINQ (`.Where`, `.Select`, `.Any`)   | Iterator + delegate allocation  | `for` loop                          |
| `string.Format()` / interpolation    | String allocation               | `StringBuilder` or cache            |
| `new List<T>()`                      | Heap allocation                 | `Buffers<T>.List.Get()`             |
| Lambda capturing locals              | Closure allocation              | Static lambda or explicit loop      |
| Boxing (`object x = struct`)         | Heap allocation                 | Generic methods                     |
| `foreach` through an INTERFACE       | Enumerator boxing (24 bytes)    | Iterate the concrete type           |
| `params` methods                     | Array allocation per call       | Chain 2-arg overloads               |
| Reflection                           | Slow, fragile, uncached         | Direct access, interfaces, generics |
| Hand-rolled hash codes (`* 31`, XOR) | Inconsistent, non-deterministic | `Objects.HashCode()`                |

## Removing From a List Nobody Reads in Order

`List<T>.RemoveAt(i)` shifts every element after `i`. When the list's order is not observed, use
`IListExtensions.RemoveAtSwapBack(i)`, which moves the last element into the hole instead.

```csharp
// ✅ CORRECT - a set of checked-out items; Dispose drains all of it, lookup scans all of it
_inFlight.RemoveAtSwapBack(index);

// ❌ WRONG for the same list - pays O(n) to preserve an order nothing reads
_inFlight.RemoveAt(index);
```

Both conditions must hold before swapping:

1. **No caller observes the order** — not the enumeration, not a query result, not a test's
   `CollectionAssert.AreEqual`. Check the tests before changing a container's removal, because the
   order a data structure never promised is often the order a fixture asserts.
2. **The index is not already the last one** — `RemoveAt(list.Count - 1)` shifts nothing and is
   already O(1); swapping there is noise.

Do **not** swap in a list whose order is the meaning: a stack (`_colorStack`, `_materialStack`), a
ring buffer's contents, a breadcrumb trail, a purge queue ordered by return time, or a hull. And
inside a **forward** loop that keeps iterating, a swap-back moves an unvisited element into the
current index — either iterate backwards or re-test the same index.

## Bulk Copy Loses When the Destination Is Covariant

`Array.Copy` and `List<T>.CopyTo` beat a per-element loop **only when the source and destination
element types match exactly**. Store into an array through a covariant view -- a `BoxCollider[]`
handed around as `Component[]` -- and the runtime re-checks the element type on **every** element,
which costs more than the loop it replaced.

Measured on Unity 6000.4.6f1 Mono, building a `BoxCollider[]` from a `List<Component>`, best of three
trials (us):

|   n | `for` loop with `as` | `List.CopyTo` | `Array.Copy` |
| --: | -------------------: | ------------: | -----------: |
|   5 |           **0.0878** |        0.3439 |       0.3692 |
|  50 |           **0.6721** |        2.4317 |       2.2156 |
| 500 |           **6.4056** |       23.3469 |      20.8070 |

The bulk calls are 3.6-3.9x slower, and **the ratio is flat across sizes** -- the tell that this is
per-element cost, not fixed overhead that amortizes. A copy that gets relatively worse as `n` grows
is not a bulk win however it is spelled.

It is also not always legal: casting `TElement[]` to `TSource[]` throws `InvalidCastException` when
`TElement` is an **interface**, because an interface array is not a covariant view of a class array.

```csharp
// Wrong: every store re-checks the element type, and this throws for an interface TElement.
TElement[] result = new TElement[count];
source.CopyTo(0, (TSource[])(object)result, 0, count);

// Right: the loop stores into the array's own exact element type.
TElement[] result = new TElement[count];
for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i)
{
    result[i] = source[i] as TElement;
}
```

**When you want the bulk win, change what fills the buffer, not the copy.** Getting the source into
a `List<TElement>` makes `CopyTo` an exact-type memmove; that is where the gain is (measured 1.15x at
five elements rising to 1.41x at five hundred, end to end). Whether that is reachable is a separate
question -- for Unity component queries it needs a run-time-closed generic, which IL2CPP has refused
here before.

## Thread Safety Patterns

Use conditional compilation for thread-safe vs single-threaded builds:

```csharp
#if SINGLE_THREADED
private static readonly Dictionary<Type, object> Cache = new();
#else
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<Type, object> Cache = new();
#endif
```

### Populating a cache must be atomic

Memoizing into a `ConcurrentDictionary` with `TryGetValue`, then building on a miss, then storing
through the **indexer** is not atomic. Two callers racing a first use each build, and each returns a
different instance than the one that ends up cached. When the build has a side effect -- a probe
call, a registration, a log -- it happens twice.

```csharp
// WRONG: last-write-wins, and the value you return may not be the value that was cached
if (!Cache.TryGetValue(key, out Value cached))
{
    cached = Build(key);
    Cache[key] = cached;
}
return cached;

// RIGHT: one winner, and every caller gets it. The state-taking overload keeps the
// lambda `static`, so no closure is allocated for the argument the factory needs.
return Cache.GetOrAdd(key, static (k, arg) => Build(k, arg), argument);
```

`GetOrAdd`'s factory may still run more than once under contention -- that is documented and
unavoidable -- but only one result is ever stored and returned, which is the property that matters.

Keep the plain `TryGetValue`-then-indexer form **only** under `SINGLE_THREADED`, where the field is a
plain `Dictionary` and there is no race to lose.

`scripts/lint-concurrent-cache-fill.ps1` enforces this. It tracks preprocessor state, so the
`SINGLE_THREADED` form does not trip it, and a deliberate last-writer-wins overwrite is exempted by
a `// concurrent-overwrite: <why>` comment on the write line or anywhere in the contiguous comment
block above it. Do not reach for that marker to silence a fill -- it is for a write that _must_
replace an earlier answer, such as an explicit registration overriding what inference cached.

**It catches one direction only, and the other is easier to get wrong.** Nothing flags a
`GetOrAdd`/`TryAdd` that should have stayed an overwrite, and that conversion is silent and
permanent. Session 217 nearly shipped one: a drawer cached a constructor factory, and when that
factory returned `null` it fell back to `Activator` and **overwrote** the cache; as `TryAdd` the
overwrite became a no-op, so the first call worked and every later one hit the broken factory and
returned `false`. The test is not "is the value deterministic" but **"can this key already hold
something this write is meant to replace?"** -- i.e. does any path reach the write _after_ something
already stored under that key, rather than only through an early `TryGetValue` miss.

### A cache factory must be `static`, and a method group is not free

The factory is built **before** the call, so whatever it costs is paid on every call, cache hit
included. 400,000 warm hits per shape on 6000.4.6f1, control moved 30.6 MB:

| factory shape                            | bytes per call |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------: |
| lambda capturing a method parameter      |      **115.8** |
| method group (`GetOrAdd(key, Build)`)    |      **106.3** |
| `static` lambda + state-taking overload  |            0.0 |
| cached `static readonly Func<...>` field |            0.1 |

- **Mark every cache-factory lambda `static`** (the linter enforces this). It is not cheaper -- a
  non-capturing lambda is cached in a static field either way. It makes the compiler **reject** a
  capture (`CS8820`), so the expensive shape stops compiling. That sweep found five capturing
  factories in `Runtime` and two in `Editor` that nothing else reported.
- **Never pass a method group.** C# 9 does not cache the conversion (C# 11 does), so
  `GetOrAdd(key, Build)` allocates every call. Hold it in a `static readonly Func<...>`. No source
  linter can catch this -- it is lexically identical to a local holding a delegate -- so the shipped
  **`WUH001`** analyzer does, with the semantic model. It covers `ConcurrentDictionary`,
  `ConditionalWeakTable` and this package's own `DictionaryExtensions`
  (`GetOrAdd`/`GetOrElse`/`AddOrUpdate`), which is how a plain `Dictionary` is reached.

**Measure the capture in a method, not a loop.** The first run of that table read **0 B/call** for
the capturing lambda, because a captured _local_ beside the loop gets one display class. Real code
captures a **parameter**, so a fresh one is built per call. Reproduce the method, not the shape.

### A monitor around a cache read is the whole call when the answer is "nothing to do"

A `lock` costs ~15 ns more than a `ConcurrentDictionary` read -- nothing beside the work most callers
then do, and everything beside the work a caller does when the answer is `false`.
`RelationalComponentAssigner.HasRelationalAssignments` was the case: `AssignHierarchy` asks it per
component, and most components have no relational field, so for them the lookup _is_ the call.
Best of three on 6000.4.6f1:

| shape                              |    cost |
| ---------------------------------- | ------: |
| `lock` + `Dictionary.TryGetValue`  | 23.1 ns |
| `ConcurrentDictionary.TryGetValue` |  7.7 ns |

That 15.4 ns was **26%** of a non-relational component: `AssignHierarchy` over 601 of them went from
59.7 to 41.5 ns each. Before assuming a lock is negligible, ask what the call does when the cache
says "no".

A guard the factory cannot express -- "only build when I have a live probe" -- still belongs in front
of `GetOrAdd`, because a factory handed a bad argument would cache a refusal for a reason that has
nothing to do with the key.

For primitives, use `Volatile` or `Interlocked`:

```csharp
private static int _counter;

// Thread-safe increment
int newValue = Interlocked.Increment(ref _counter);

// Thread-safe read/write
int current = Volatile.Read(ref _counter);
Volatile.Write(ref _counter, newValue);
```

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting any code, verify:

- [ ] No LINQ in hot paths
- [ ] No closures capturing variables
- [ ] All temporary collections use `Buffers<T>` (hand-rolling a `[ThreadStatic]` scratch instead is
      a call-site-specific optimization, not a default -- see below)
- [ ] All temporary arrays use appropriate pool
- [ ] No reflection on code we control (use `internal` + `[InternalsVisibleTo]`)
- [ ] Value types used where appropriate
- [ ] Hash codes cached for dictionary keys
- [ ] Editor code caches GUIContent/GUIStyle
- [ ] `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.AggressiveInlining)]` on hot paths
- [ ] Thread safety uses conditional compilation pattern
- [ ] No duplicated code - extract common patterns to abstractions

## A Pool Lease Is the Default; a Hand-Rolled Scratch Needs Its Own Number

`Buffers<T>` is the default for a temporary collection. Replacing it with a `[ThreadStatic]` list is
an optimization, and its result **does not transfer between call sites** -- measured both ways in
this repository, on the same editor, in the same family of methods:

| call site                     | whole call |                               `Buffers<T>` lease vs `[ThreadStatic]` |
| ----------------------------- | ---------: | -------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| sibling relational assignment |    ~1.0 µs |                                    lease **7% slower** (session 215) |
| child relational assignment   |    ~4.7 µs | lease **2% faster**, 0.976-0.983x over three orderings (session 216) |

The lease's cost is roughly fixed, so it is a large fraction of a cheap call and a negligible one of
an expensive call. That is the whole explanation, and it is why "we hand-rolled a scratch in the
neighbouring method" is not a reason to hand-roll one here.

So: reach for `Buffers<T>`. Specialize only with a number for **that** call site, run in more than
one ordering, and leave the number in a comment where the next reader will find it.
