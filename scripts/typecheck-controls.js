/*
    Negative controls for the five local type-check gates.

    Those gates report a defect by failing, so a clean run and a gate that has stopped working are
    the same output. `typecheck:tests` has already been measured exiting 0 on a tree the same
    command found four WPROTO044 errors on once `obj/` was deleted (session 238), and a project
    that silently lost an `<Analyzer Include>` line, an excluded source root, or a severity would
    read exactly as green. This injects a file carrying a known diagnostic into each project and
    asserts the build names it, so the green run beside it is a measurement rather than the absence
    of one (#636).

    TWO control files rather than one, and this is measured, not stylistic: with a `CS0246` in the
    same compilation the `WUH###` analyzer reported nothing at all, while `WPROTO001` still fired
    from the generator. A combined control would therefore have reported the analyzer as broken on
    every run. The compiler control is built on its own for that reason.

    Each control also names an ANCHOR type from the tree that project is the only local compiler
    of. Without one the whole run is satisfied by the control file alone: a project whose
    `Runtime/**` glob had gone empty still loads the analyzers, still reports both diagnostics
    against the control, and still reads as a working gate over nothing. The anchor makes an empty
    tree a `CS0246` on a name that must resolve, which the exact-set match below turns into a
    failure that says so.

    The reported diagnostics must match the expected set EXACTLY. `Generator~/Directory.Build.props`
    makes warnings errors, so a tree with any other finding is a tree whose ordinary type-check is
    already red -- and reporting that here, rather than tolerating it, is what keeps a control from
    passing on a build that was going to fail anyway.

    The controls reach the compilation through the `WallstopCheckControl` property, which every
    check project declares and nothing else sets. An ordinary build adds no file.
