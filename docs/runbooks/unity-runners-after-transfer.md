# Unity Runners After Repository Transfer Runbook

This runbook explains how to restore self-hosted Unity runner access after a repository is transferred between GitHub organizations (or when a freshly provisioned runner does not pick up queued Unity jobs). Keep execution notes local. Do not paste secrets, screenshots of organization settings, or other private account metadata into this file or any tracked follow-up.

It is referenced by the `runner-preflight` job in `.github/workflows/unity-tests.yml`, `.github/workflows/unity-benchmarks.yml`, and `.github/workflows/runner-bootstrap.yml`, and by `scripts/unity/ensure-editor.ps1` and `.github/actions/print-self-hosted-runner-diagnostics`.

## Symptom

- A queued Unity workflow run (for example **Unity Tests** or **Unity Benchmarks**) stays queued indefinitely.
- The GitHub Actions UI shows the job waiting for a runner. There is no error, no warning, and the run never starts.
- The organization's self-hosted runners report Online and Idle in the GitHub UI, with labels that exactly match the workflow's `runs-on` request (`self-hosted`, `Windows`, `RAM-64GB`).
- The watchdog defined in `.github/workflows/stuck-job-watchdog.yml` does not recover the run because no idle runner is visible to the repository, so the watchdog's label-matching rule never fires.

## Root cause

After a repository transfer between GitHub organizations, the destination organization's runner groups do not automatically include the transferred repository in their repository-access list. When a runner group is configured as "Selected repositories", any repository that is not explicitly listed cannot dispatch jobs to that group's runners. The dispatcher does not log an error in this state; the job simply stays queued.

This is a configuration-state issue, not the intermittent dispatcher bug tracked upstream as [GitHub Community Discussion #186811](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186811). The dispatcher bug applies when an idle matching runner _is_ visible to the repository through the GitHub API but never receives the job. If the API does not list the runner at all for the repository, this runbook applies instead.

## Diagnose with the GitHub CLI

Run the following from any workstation with `gh auth login` already completed. Replace `<org>` with the destination organization that owns the runners.

List the organization's runner groups, including each group's visibility setting:

```bash
gh api orgs/<org>/actions/runner-groups \
  -q '.runner_groups[] | {id, name, visibility, allows_public_repositories}'
```

For a runner group whose visibility is `selected`, list the repositories that currently have access:

```bash
gh api orgs/<org>/actions/runner-groups/<group-id>/repositories \
  -q '.repositories[] | {id, name, full_name}'
```

If `Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers` does not appear in that list, the dispatcher has no path to the group's runners from this repository, which matches the symptom above.

Cross-check by listing runners that the repository itself can see:

```bash
gh api repos/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/actions/runners \
  -q '.runners[] | {id, name, status, busy, labels: [.labels[].name]}'
```

When this list is empty or omits the expected runner names while the organization-level inventory shows them online, the access list is the cause.

## Resolution

Choose one of the following inside the destination organization. Either restores dispatch; pick the one that matches the organization's security model.

Add the transferred repository to the selected list:

1. Organization Settings.
2. Actions.
3. Runner groups.
4. Default (or the relevant group).
5. Repository access.
6. Add `wallstop/unity-helpers` to the list.
7. Save.

Change the group's visibility to all repositories:

1. Organization Settings.
2. Actions.
3. Runner groups.
4. Default (or the relevant group).
5. Repository access.
6. Set visibility to all repositories.
7. Save.

The second resolution avoids future per-transfer maintenance but exposes the runners to every repository in the organization. Use it only when that exposure is acceptable for the runner group's security posture.

After applying the chosen resolution, re-run the queued workflow from the Actions tab. The `runner-preflight` job in each licensed Unity test, benchmark, or bootstrap workflow validates runner access from `ubuntu-latest` before any matrix entry attempts to dispatch onto self-hosted; a green preflight confirms the fix.

## Preflight diagnostic in this repository

Unity workflows run a `runner-preflight` job on `ubuntu-latest` before the self-hosted matrix. The preflight uses the organization reader GitHub App and requests only organization self-hosted-runner read permission. It asks GitHub for runner groups visible to `Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers`, then considers only runners inside those groups when matching the exact `runs-on` labels.

The preflight fails closed. Missing reader credentials, an App authentication or API failure, no runner group visible to this repository, malformed or truncated inventory, or no accessible online runner with every required label all make the check red. It never emits a green soft pass. Busy online runners remain eligible because GitHub can queue the licensed job until one becomes idle.

The `Unity CI Success` aggregate job runs with `always()` and is the required branch-protection check. It rejects a failed or cancelled preflight and rejects an unexpected skipped licensed job, so a runner outage cannot produce a green Unity check merely because dependent jobs were skipped.

The reader App must be installed for the organization and expose the organization secrets `BUILD_LOCK_READER_APP_ID` and `BUILD_LOCK_READER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` to this repository. Its organization permission is Self-hosted runners: read. No PAT or repository-level environment is required.

If the preflight passes but the matrix job still stays queued, the cause is more likely the dispatcher bug (see [GitHub Community Discussion #186811](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/186811)) than the access list. Use the recovery workflows in this repository: `.github/workflows/unstick-run.yml` for manual recovery of a single run, and `.github/workflows/stuck-job-watchdog.yml` for the automated 5-minute scan.

### The watchdog's second recovery mode

The same watchdog also recovers a different symptom: a completed run reported `cancelled` whose jobs all succeeded step by step. GitHub occasionally marks a job `cancelled` even though every one of its steps, `Complete job` included, reported success; dependent jobs then skip on the unmet `needs:` and `Unity CI Success` reports red with no diff to explain it. A plain re-run of the same run id goes green.

The watchdog detects that signature (a job with `conclusion: cancelled` whose step list is non-empty and whose every step succeeded) and re-runs the run through `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{id}/rerun`. A deliberate cancel never matches, because its in-flight step is itself cancelled rather than successful.

Two bounds keep it from looping. The run's `run_attempt` must be at most `MAX_RERUN_ATTEMPT`, so a re-run that lands in the same state escalates to a human, and re-runs are capped at `MAX_RERUNS_PER_DAY` per run id in a state file on the `watchdog-state` branch. Both appear in the workflow's `env:` block.

This re-run uses the workflow's own `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose job-level `actions: write` grant already covers it. It does **not** use the build-lock reader App, which is read-only by design; do not widen that App to enable this.

## Machine-name labels for runner bootstrap

The manual `.github/workflows/runner-bootstrap.yml` workflow performs host maintenance on one specific Windows runner. Each runner must therefore have a custom label that exactly matches its runner name:

- `DAD-MACHINE`
- `ELI-MACHINE`

The bootstrap job requests `self-hosted`, `Windows`, `RAM-64GB`, and the selected machine-name label. GitHub schedules a self-hosted job only on runners that have every requested label, so this prevents an ELI bootstrap from silently running on DAD, or the reverse. The workflow still keeps a hard runner-identity check as a final guard against label drift.

If a bootstrap dispatch stays queued after selecting a runner, verify the runner is online and that the matching machine-name label is present in Settings -> Actions -> Runners. Do not work around the queue by removing the machine-name label from the workflow; that reintroduces wrong-runner maintenance.

## Install a new Windows runner agent

The workflow bootstrap can maintain only an agent that is already online. For a new machine, `scripts/unity/install-windows-actions-runner.ps1` separates the work that requires elevation from the package download that should run as the ordinary runner owner. Obtain the current Windows x64 runner version, its published SHA-256, and a short-lived registration token from **Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New self-hosted runner**. Never commit or transcribe the token into logs.

First, open Windows PowerShell 5.1 as administrator and prepare the service directory. Replace the account and machine name examples with the actual runner owner and one of the repository's expected runner names:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\unity\install-windows-actions-runner.ps1 `
  -Phase AdminPrepare -InstallRoot C:\actions-runner -RunnerUser runner-owner
```

Then sign in as `runner-owner` and install the checksum-verified runner package without elevation:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\unity\install-windows-actions-runner.ps1 `
  -Phase UserInstall -InstallRoot C:\actions-runner `
  -RunnerVersion <version-from-github> -ArchiveSha256 <sha256-from-github>
```

Finally, return to an administrator prompt and register the agent as a Windows service. Pass the token only at invocation time; the script deliberately does not print it. The runner-name label is added automatically alongside `RAM-64GB`, which makes the machine eligible for both Unity jobs and targeted maintenance:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\unity\install-windows-actions-runner.ps1 `
  -Phase AdminConfigure -InstallRoot C:\actions-runner `
  -RegistrationUrl https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive `
  -RegistrationToken <short-lived-token> -RunnerName DAD-MACHINE
```

Once the agent reports online, dispatch **Runner Bootstrap (Windows)** in maintenance mode. That installs the host prerequisites and every Unity editor from `.github/unity-versions.json`, including all supported build-target components. Host preparation runs once, then each editor runs in its own serialized six-hour job. A slow editor therefore cannot consume the timeout for later versions, and GitHub can rerun only the failed version leg.

## Run maintenance directly on a Windows runner

When you are already on the runner host, you do not need to run YAML. From a checkout of this repository, run the same maintenance backend directly:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\unity\maintain-windows-runner.ps1
```

The script reads `.github\unity-versions.json` when `-UnityVersions` is omitted and writes diagnostics under `.artifacts\runner-bootstrap`. Its Unity install-root precedence is explicit `-InstallRoot`, `UNITY_EDITOR_INSTALL_ROOT`, the Actions runner tool-cache environment, the runner service's `.env` tool-cache setting, the Actions default `<runner>\_work\_tool\u6-v3`, then `Unity\Editors` on the checkout's drive. A runner whose `.env` sets `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE=<runner>\_tool` therefore uses `<runner>\_tool\u6-v3`, exactly like its workflow jobs. This keeps large editor payloads off `C:` when the runner lives on another drive and makes interactive maintenance reuse the same editors as workflow jobs. Its default `Full` profile installs and verifies Windows IL2CPP, Android (including SDK/NDK/OpenJDK), WebGL, iOS, Linux Mono/IL2CPP, and macOS Mono build support; the workflow uses the same profile. Maintenance installs the standalone Unity CLI when absent and otherwise runs its current `self-update` command before provisioning. All CLI operations are non-interactive, use built-in download retries, stream progress, and have bounded wall-clock and no-output timeouts. `UH_UNITY_CLI_UPDATE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `UH_UNITY_CLI_INSTALL_STALL_SECONDS`, `UH_UNITY_CLI_UPDATE_STALL_SECONDS`, and `UH_UNITY_CLI_UPDATE_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` override the install/update defaults for diagnosis.

Unity CLI `1.0.0-beta.9` has a [confirmed upstream Windows compatibility defect](https://discussions.unity.com/t/unity-cli-1-0-0-beta-9-is-rolling-out/1736105/7) where an older installation database can fail with `table installs has no column named writer_kind`. Maintenance recognizes only that exact signature, rolls back to `1.0.0-beta.8`, retries the interrupted command, and writes a 12-hour compatibility marker beside the CLI executable so subsequent editor legs do not immediately reinstall the broken build. The hold expires automatically, allowing a fixed newer beta to be adopted without operator cleanup. If rollback fails, maintenance refuses to uninstall, quarantine, or clear payloads because the failure is CLI metadata—not editor corruption.

For an audit that never installs or repairs anything:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\unity\maintain-windows-runner.ps1 -DetectOnly
```

`UH_RUNNER_DISABLE_AUTO_BOOTSTRAP=1` also forces detect-only mode for both `maintain-windows-runner.ps1` and `bootstrap-windows-runner.ps1`, matching the workflow override.

## PowerShell 7 prerequisite on self-hosted runners

Self-hosted Windows Unity runners require **PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`)** in addition to Git Bash. Every Unity workflow consumes the `print-self-hosted-runner-diagnostics` composite action (`.github/actions/print-self-hosted-runner-diagnostics/action.yml`) before its own steps, and that action plus the Unity run/provision steps run with `shell: pwsh`. PowerShell 7 is _not_ the Windows-built-in PowerShell 5.1 (`powershell`); it is a separate install that provides the `pwsh` executable.

### Symptom

- A self-hosted Unity job fails almost immediately with `##[error]pwsh: command not found`.
- The failure originates from the first `shell: pwsh` step the agent reaches.
- Git Bash and the runner agent are otherwise healthy.

The diagnostics composite action fails fast with a clear, actionable error annotation (`pwsh missing on self-hosted runner`) when `pwsh` is absent, so this state no longer surfaces only as the cryptic `pwsh: command not found`. The preflight step that emits that error runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1, which is always present, so it executes even when PowerShell 7 is missing.

### Install PowerShell 7

On a machine with winget:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

For machines without winget, download and run the latest MSI installer from the official releases page: <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases>.

### Verify

Open a **new** shell (so the updated PATH is picked up) and confirm:

```powershell
pwsh -v
Get-Command pwsh
```

`pwsh -v` should print the installed PowerShell 7 version, and `Get-Command pwsh` should resolve to the installed executable's path.

### Restart the runner agent

After installing PowerShell 7, restart the self-hosted runner service/agent (or refresh the machine's PATH and restart the runner) so the agent process sees `pwsh` on its PATH. The runner agent inherits its environment at start time; until it is restarted it keeps reporting `pwsh: command not found` even though a fresh interactive shell can find `pwsh`. Re-run the queued Unity workflow once the agent is back online.

## The persistent Unity project root

Each Unity leg generates a throwaway Unity project whose `Library` holds the import
database and the compiled assemblies. That project lives **outside the checkout**, at:

```text
<RUNNER_WORKSPACE>\unity-workspace\projects\<unity-version>-<mode>[-<scope>]
<RUNNER_WORKSPACE>\unity-workspace\cache\<unity-version>
```

It has to. `actions/checkout` runs `git clean -ffdx` at the top of every job and `-x`
means gitignored, so anything under the repository's `.artifacts/` tree is deleted
before the job starts, including the `Library` the previous leg had just built on
that same disk. Keeping the project one directory up puts it out of `git clean`'s
reach, so a leg reuses its own local copy instead of downloading one.

Operator notes:

- **Confirm reuse.** Every run logs `Library: warm (reused)` or
  `Library: cold (first run on this runner)` in the `Ephemeral Unity project` group.
  A leg that reports `cold` on every run means the root is not surviving between
  jobs; check whether something is wiping `RUNNER_WORKSPACE`.
- **Disk is the trade.** This buys back cache transfer time by keeping the projects
  on local disk. `run-ci-tests.ps1` prunes least-recently-used sibling projects when
  free space drops below its floor (`-ProjectRootMinimumFreeGb`, default 60 GB) and
  never prunes the leg that is about to run. The runner diagnostics block prints
  `Workspace volume: <drive> N GB free of M GB` every run.
- **Force a cold rebuild** for one leg by deleting its directory under
  `unity-workspace\projects`; the next run regenerates it.
- A leg that moves between the two runners is handled automatically:
  `Clear-StaleUnityCompilationCache` notices the repo-root marker changed and clears
  `Library\Bee`, `ScriptAssemblies`, `PlayerScriptAssemblies`, and `Il2cppBuildCache`.

## Git compression tools for Actions cache

Self-hosted Windows Unity runners also need Git for Windows' Unix tools available to GitHub Actions cache steps. `actions/cache` restores and saves archives through `tar` and `gzip`; when the runner PATH exposes Git Bash but omits `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin`, cache post steps can warn with `gzip: command not found` and fail to save a cache entry. The Unity `Library` is no longer among them (see the section above), but the prepend stays because it is cheap and any future cache step on these runners needs it.

The `print-self-hosted-runner-diagnostics` composite action prepends Git's `usr\bin` directory to `$GITHUB_PATH` when it finds both `gzip.exe` and `tar.exe`, and emits a warning when that directory is absent. To verify locally on the runner:

```powershell
Get-Command gzip.exe
Get-Command tar.exe
```

If either command is missing, install Git for Windows or add `C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin` to the runner service PATH, then restart the runner agent.

## Never use plain `shell: bash` on self-hosted Windows runners

On a self-hosted Windows runner, `shell: bash` can resolve to the WSL stub at `C:\Windows\System32\bash.exe`, which tries to launch a WSL distro that is usually not installed and fails with "Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions." The diagnostics composite warns when the runner PATH resolves bash to that stub (Git Bash must precede `System32` in PATH). Unity workflow steps therefore use `shell: pwsh` (or `shell: powershell` for steps that must run before PowerShell 7 is installed) rather than `shell: bash`.

## Windows host prerequisites (0xC0000135 / STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND)

If `Unity.exe` fails at startup with `-1073741515` / `0xC0000135` (STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND), the host is missing an OS-level dependency Unity imports, most commonly the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables (both the 2010 SP1 and the 2015-2022 x64 generations). This is an OS-level fix; `ensure-editor.ps1`'s Unity-reinstall retry loop cannot repair it (the missing DLL is on the OS, not in the Unity install). `ensure-editor.ps1` detects this case and short-circuits with a clear error rather than retrying futilely.

The manual `workflow_dispatch` workflow `.github/workflows/runner-bootstrap.yml` is the supported remote remediation path for this state. Dispatch it with the affected machine-name label (`DAD-MACHINE` or `ELI-MACHINE`) and leave `detect-only` disabled to run host maintenance. The workflow calls `scripts/unity/maintain-windows-runner.ps1`, which first runs `scripts/unity/bootstrap-windows-runner.ps1` for OS prerequisites and then verifies every Unity editor listed in `.github/unity-versions.json` through `ensure-editor.ps1`. If you are logged into the runner host directly, run `scripts\unity\maintain-windows-runner.ps1` from the checkout instead.

For emergency manual repair, apply the same host prerequisites that the bootstrap backend manages:

1. Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 x64 Redistributable (provides `MSVCP100.dll` / `MSVCR100.dll`).
2. Install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 x64 Redistributable (provides `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`, `MSVCP140.dll`).
3. Enable Windows long paths (`git config --system core.longpaths true` and the `LongPathsEnabled` registry value).
4. Add Windows Defender exclusions for the Unity install root and the runner work directory to avoid scan-induced timeouts.
5. Install PowerShell 7 (see above).

Re-run the queued Unity workflow once the bootstrap run completes successfully or the host is prepared manually. If the bootstrap dispatch stays queued, first verify that the target runner is online and carries the matching machine-name label; do not remove that label from `runner-bootstrap.yml` to force scheduling.

## Required secrets

The Unity workflows expect the following repository (or organization) secrets. They are NOT provisioned by this batch; a maintainer must add them before the first self-hosted run:

- `UNITY_SERIAL`, `UNITY_EMAIL`, `UNITY_PASSWORD`: classic serial Unity activation (all three required together).
- `BUILD_LOCK_APP_ID`, `BUILD_LOCK_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: dedicated GitHub App credentials for the `wallstop-organization-builds` organization build lock (`Ambiguous-Interactive/ambiguous-organization-build-lock`); both are required together and should be provisioned as organization secrets with access to this repository.
- `BUILD_LOCK_READER_APP_ID`, `BUILD_LOCK_READER_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`: read-only GitHub App credentials used by the hosted runner preflight; both are required together and should be provisioned as organization secrets with access to this repository.
- `UNITY_ACCELERATOR_ENDPOINT`: optional; enables the Unity Accelerator cache namespace when set.

Provision the required Unity and build-lock credentials as organization secrets selected for this repository. The licensed workflows intentionally do not bind jobs to a per-repository environment, so trusted pull requests from branches in this repository validate automatically without an environment approval. Pull requests from forks remain ineligible for licensed jobs and do not receive these secrets.

## Focused native acceptance

Manually dispatch **Unity Tests** with `acceptance` set to `sentinel`, `intmap`, or `all`.
The default is `none`. The selected normal test modes still run; acceptance adds work under the
same organization license lease. `unity-version` can select a supported editor to bound the run.
Artifacts named `unity-<version>-acceptance` contain separate result directories and a summary.
Each requested test, verification, credential redaction and upload must succeed. These optional
runs do not restore the separate disabled benchmark or release workflows.

The runner creates fresh projects and removes them after results are copied outside the project.
If an editor remains active, cleanup retains the project and fails with its path for diagnosis.
There are no automatic measurement retries. An inconclusive result is evidence to inspect, not a
reason to repeat runs until a favorable number appears.

`run-ci-tests.ps1 -TestFilter 'Namespace.Fixture.Method'` forwards Unity's test-name filter
in EditMode, PlayMode and standalone builds. It preserves the assembly and category filters.
The script no longer resolves an editor itself: set `UNITY_EDITOR_PATH` to a CI-managed editor
first (in CI the central `ensure-unity-editor` gate publishes it; locally run the repository's
`ensure-editor.ps1` helper with `-CiManagedOnly -RequireHealthyExisting`). Without it the script
fails closed. A filtered run requires at least one passing test: zero matches, all skipped, and
entirely inconclusive results cannot establish acceptance. The NUnit XML and logs remain
available when this check fails, including an IntMap measurement rejected for unstable timing.

The explicit `ValidationWorkspaceInteractionTests.NativePanelCallbacksRetainDraftAndPersistSettings`
fixture exercises native field-change and button-submit callbacks. It requires batchmode and a fresh,
expendable project whose directory name begins `sentinel-interaction-`. Before starting Unity, set
`WALLSTOP_SENTINEL_INTERACTION_PROJECT` to that exact absolute project root, set
`WALLSTOP_SENTINEL_INTERACTION_TOKEN` to a new GUID in 32-character `N` format, and write the same token
to `.sentinel-interaction-disposable` in the project root. Select the full test name in namespace
`WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Tests.Editor.Validation`, using its validation test assembly and a
fresh `-ProjectPath`. The fixture checks every marker before changing settings, Undo or native objects.

An exclusive CI checkout with no other active editor may supply the package through the runner's
normal `file:` dependency. A second package copy is unnecessary in that case: this fixture writes
only its disposable project's settings and creates objects it destroys afterward. A local shared
checkout requires an isolated source copy. The existing Library provenance markers do not authorize
this test in a developer project, and batchmode alone is insufficient.

Retain the NUnit XML and editor log, then discard the marked project. The fixture restores its
recorded settings and Undo group as cleanup, but it does not promise to preserve arbitrary preexisting
Undo/redo history or global subscribers. A pass proves callback delivery, draft retention and saved
settings; it does not prove pixels, mouse hit testing, focus, graph dragging or domain-reload recovery.

## Package exports

Release Publish creates the `.unitypackage` on an `ubuntu-latest` runner without opening Unity or
using a license. `scripts/unity/create-unitypackage.js` stages the validated npm payload, renames
`Samples~` to `Samples`, preserves every tracked asset GUID, and writes the Unity archive plus its
SHA256 sidecar. Generated package-root and renamed-sample folder GUIDs are stable hashes of their
paths instead of fresh values from each temporary Unity project.

The Unity Tests smoke job remains on the `self-hosted`, `Windows`, `RAM-64GB` fleet. It imports and
compiles the same staged Assets payload with release optimization before using Unity's native
export API. This retains sample compilation and native import/export coverage without putting the
release workflow behind runner availability or a paid license. Its acquire, activation, return,
classification, release, and cleanup gate remain one fail-closed physical-runner lifecycle.

The shell exporter remains available for local Docker comparison and delegates staging to the same
Node implementation. Compare the portable and native archives by logical path, asset bytes, and
metadata; Unity may rewrite text assets while importing them, so archive-byte equality is not a
valid compatibility check.

For a release-export canary, dispatch Release Publish with `export_only: true`, the package's current
version, and the candidate commit as `source_ref`. It validates metadata and produces both package
artifacts without waiting for a Unity runner, then skips tag mutation and publication. The selected
source SHA is retained in the job outputs so the canary can be compared with the smoke run on the
same revision.
