# Test Script: the license-year walk's copy detection is load-bearing
# =============================================================================
# Regression coverage for issue #680, which asked whether
# `--find-copies-harder` could be dropped or split out of the single history
# walk in scripts/license-year-lib.sh. It is 90% of the walk's cost, so the
# question was worth asking, and the answer is no: 24 tracked .cs files resolve
# to a DIFFERENT year without it, every one of them to a LATER year than the
# header the repository already carries. Dropping the flag would make
# scripts/audit-license-years.sh reject 24 files nobody has touched.
#
# This test names all 24, so removing the expensive pass reds the build here --
# with the list of casualties in the failure output -- rather than in a
# repository-wide audit that only says "24 mismatches".
#
# It runs against THIS repository rather than a synthetic one on purpose. The
# 24 files are a property of this history: they were extracted out of existing
# sources, so git can only date them by pairing each with the unmodified file it
# came from, and only `--find-copies-harder` considers unmodified files as copy
# sources. A fixture repository would be asserting the flag's documentation
# rather than the corpus that depends on it.
#
# The red half patches a COPY of the shipped library, deleting exactly the line
# that passes the flag, and asserts the deletion landed. Remove the flag from
# the real library and both halves go red: the green one because the 24 years
# move, the red one because there is no longer a line to delete.

# Run: bash scripts/tests/test-license-year-copy-detection.sh
