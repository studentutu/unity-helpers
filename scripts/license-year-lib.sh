# license-year-lib.sh - Shared copyright-year resolution for the MIT license header tools.
#
# Sourced by scripts/update-license-headers.sh (the fixer) and scripts/audit-license-years.sh
# (the auditor) so the two cannot answer the same question two different ways.
#
# Before this library existed they each ran their own `git log --follow --diff-filter=A` and
# issue #668 fell straight through the gap. `git log` never consults the index, so for a STAGED
# rename (`git mv old.cs new.cs`) that query returns nothing: the new path exists only in the
# index. Both scripts then fell back to the current year -- the fixer rewrote a 2024 header to
# 2026, and the auditor, asking the identical question, agreed and reported success. The
# disagreement only appeared once the rename was committed, when the auditor's repository-wide
# scan followed the rename back through the `R` status, expected 2024, and reddened CI.
#
# Resolution order for a repository-relative path:
#   1. Committed history for the path (`git log --follow --diff-filter=A`).
#   2. The source of a STAGED rename onto that path, resolved recursively.
#   3. The current year.
# The answer is then clamped up to the repository's start year.
#
# Only a STAGED rename is visible here, and that is a real limit rather than an oversight. An
# unstaged rename is a deletion plus an untracked file; `git diff -M` cannot pair those, because
# the new file is not in the index for it to compare against. Such a file still resolves to the
# current year. `git mv` stages, and staging before validating is the flow
# .llm/skills/validate-before-commit.md already prescribes.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$SCRIPT_DIR/license-year-lib.sh"
#   license_year_init "$REPO_ROOT" "$REPO_START_YEAR" "$CURRENT_YEAR"
#   license_year_resolve "Runtime/Foo.cs"
#   printf '%s\n' "$LICENSE_YEAR_RESULT"   # clamped year the header should carry
#   printf '%s\n' "$LICENSE_YEAR_SOURCE"   # history | staged-rename | current-year
#
# Every function reports through globals rather than stdout so callers can invoke them without a
# subshell: the staged-rename map is built once per process, and a command substitution would
# throw it away and rebuild it per file.

    # The diff MUST be unfiltered. Measured on git 2.51.1 while diagnosing #668:
    # `git diff --cached -M --name-status` reports `R100<TAB>old<TAB>new`, but adding
    # `-- <new path>` hides the deletion half of the pair, so git reports a plain `A<TAB>new` and
    # rename detection becomes impossible. Look the new path up in the whole-index result instead.
    # -z is what makes an unusual path safe: without it git quotes such a path and the lookup key
    # would no longer be the path the caller asked about.

    # -C --find-copies-harder, and the rename limit, match the auditor's repository-wide walk --
    # which is the only answer CI enforces, so the fixer has to give the same one. Measured on the
    # 326-file commit that extracted 146 test types: without the limit git prints `only found
    # copies from modified paths due to too many files` and reports ZERO copies, which reads as
    # "no copies" rather than "gave up". With it, 24, in 1.1s, including every file whose header
    # the auditor then rejected. Copy detection is noisy at the margin -- one pairing was two
    # unrelated 50%-similar test types -- but agreeing with the gate beats being independently
    # right, which is the whole lesson of #668.
