    /// A declared type with no members has no encoding. <c>IRandom</c> is the declared type this
    /// package's own documentation recommends, and nothing about the interface says which contract
    /// should read a payload written for it, so without a declaration WallstopProto has to decline
    /// and every such call travels the protobuf-net path -- the one that cannot run under IL2CPP.
    /// This is the missing sentence: for <c>IRandom</c>, the answer is <c>AbstractRandom</c>.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>It is not a guess and not a new encoding.</b> The bytes are the root contract's, which is
    /// exactly what <c>Serializer.ProtoDeserialize&lt;IRandom&gt;</c> already produces:
    /// <c>ResolveProtobufRootType</c> scans the interface's declaring assembly for a unique abstract
    /// <c>[ProtoContract]</c> base and hands protobuf-net that type. Declaring the pair states the
    /// same answer ahead of time, so the reflection scan is not needed to find it.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>It applies at the root only</b>, like <see cref="WProtoRootMarshalAttribute"/> though for
    /// a different reason. A marshal hides from the member path because its types have two
    /// encodings chosen by position; a declared root hides because a member has no encoding for it
    /// at all -- an interface-typed <c>[WProtoMember]</c> is <c>WPROTO003</c>, and the only member
    /// positions that could reach the adapter are a generic contract's type argument and a
    /// marshalled collection's element, where writing the root contract's message would be a shape
    /// protobuf-net has no counterpart for. Registered in
    /// <see cref="WProtoDeclaredRootProvider"/>, which <see cref="WProtoGeneric{T}"/> cannot see.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>A consumer's explicit registration still wins.</b>
    /// <c>Serializer.RegisterProtobufRoot(declared, root)</c> names a different root for the same
    /// declared type, and it is a runtime call about this program rather than a declaration shipped
    /// in a package, so it takes precedence whichever runs first --
    /// <see cref="WProtoDeclaredRootProvider"/> keeps the two apart rather than letting registration
    /// order decide. The adapter then declines and protobuf-net serves the call exactly as it does
    /// today.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>A second declaration is not a way to override the first.</b> Only the declaring assembly's
    /// own attributes are read, so a consumer's pair for a type this package also declares is a
    /// second registration rather than a replacement -- and both registrars run in the same
    /// unordered Unity phase, exactly as <see cref="WProtoRootMarshalProvider"/> describes. Which
