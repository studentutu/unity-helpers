// One runner for the repository's contract and self-test suite -- what `npm run validate:tests:fast`
// executes, locally and in CI.
//
// This was a serial `&&` chain of forty-five npm scripts in package.json. Measured in the
// devcontainer on eight cores, that chain took 9 m 52 s of wall clock for roughly four CPU-minutes
// of work (#505, #425): every link paid an `npm run` start-up, most of them a `pwsh -NoProfile`
// start-up on top of it, and all of them waited for the one before. Nothing about the suite required
// that order. Almost all of them are independent processes that read the tree and write only
// into per-run temporary directories, which is why the same runner Repo Lint uses applies. The
// exception is real and is marked `exclusive` below rather than assumed away: one check
// rewrites the working tree, and it took a one-in-five flake to find it.
//
// Two properties this keeps that the chain did not have:
//   * every check runs even after one fails, so a run reports the whole contract state in one go
//     rather than one failure per round trip;
//   * the registry is data, so scripts/tests/test-run-contract-tests.js can assert the suite still
//     covers every contract test in `scripts/tests/` -- the failure mode consolidation invites is a
//     test that still exists and no longer runs.
//
// Commands are the npm scripts the chain ran, verbatim, so the definition of each check still lives
// in exactly one place and the move changed no work.
