    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>The problem it solves.</b> A pool that only knows what is <i>in</i> it cannot clean up what is
    /// <i>out</i> of it. Dispose such a pool while a pooled effect is still playing and the effect stays
    /// in the scene forever, and its ending calls back into a pool that is gone. The item is owned by
    /// nothing: the pool no longer holds it and the caller handed ownership to a tween.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>Why not <see cref="WallstopGenericPool{T}"/>.</b> That pool hands out a
    /// <see cref="PooledResource{T}"/>, whose disposal returns the item — a lexical scope, which is
    /// exactly right for the scratch buffers it serves and cannot strand anything. It also cannot
    /// <i>refuse</i> a return, and refusing one is the whole point here: a destroyed Unity object put
    /// back in a pool is the next thing handed out.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>The distinction this type is built on.</b> For a <see cref="UnityEngine.Object"/>,
    /// <c>ReferenceEquals(item, null)</c> asks "was anything handed in" and <c>item == null</c> asks
    /// "has it been destroyed". They are different questions and this type needs both: an item
    /// destroyed out from under its flight is still the entry sitting in the tracking list, so removal
    /// is unconditional while returning it to the pool is not. Guarding the removal instead leaks one
    /// dead reference per use, which is the unbounded growth the list exists to prevent.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <typeparamref name="T"/> is constrained to <see cref="UnityEngine.Object"/>, so it is always a
    /// reference type and there is no value-type case to reason about — and that constraint is what
    /// makes the two questions above expressible at all. A pool for plain objects, whose lifetime is a
    /// scope, is <see cref="WallstopGenericPool{T}"/>.
    /// </para>
