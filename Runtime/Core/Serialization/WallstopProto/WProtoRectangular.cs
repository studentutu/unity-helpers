    /// A rectangular array is the one collection shape that cannot be reconstructed from its
    /// elements. <c>int[][]</c> carries its own structure -- each row is a separate run whose length
    /// is on the wire -- while <c>int[2,3]</c> and <c>int[3,2]</c> deliver the same six values in the
    /// same order, so the dimensions have to travel with them. The wrapper message is therefore
    /// <c>message Rect { repeated int32 dims = 1; repeated T values = 2; }</c>, which maps onto a
    /// concrete proto3 definition rather than onto a private convention.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>The dimensions are a claim, and this is where it is refused.</b> A length prefix is safe to
    /// allocate from because the reader will not accept one longer than the bytes it holds; a
    /// dimension header has no such backing, and six bytes can state <c>[46341, 46341]</c> and ask
    /// for 8 GB. <see cref="TryAcceptShape"/> answers that by requiring the product of the
    /// dimensions -- computed in <see cref="long"/> by the caller so it cannot overflow into
    /// something plausible -- to equal the number of elements the payload actually delivered. That is
    /// stronger than clamping it to <see cref="SerializationCapacityLimits.MaximumRestoredCapacity"/>
    /// and needs no ceiling of its own: the allocation is backed one-for-one by elements the sender
    /// already paid for in bytes, so a claim that outruns its data is refused outright rather than
    /// quietly honored up to a limit. It also catches the inverse -- a header that under-states its
    /// data -- which a ceiling would let through and which would silently drop elements.
