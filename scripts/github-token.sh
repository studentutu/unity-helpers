# The ONLY supported way to obtain a GitHub credential inside this devcontainer.
#
# Why it exists: the Dev Containers credential helper answers by raising a dialog on the OWNER'S
# DESKTOP. Every invocation raises another one, and `git push`, `git fetch` and `git credential fill`
# all invoke it -- so guidance that said "run `git credential fill`" spent an owner interruption per
# agent, per session, and a retry loop spent several. This script never contacts that helper except
# on the explicit `--bootstrap` path, which a human runs once.
#
# Resolution order (none of it prompts):
#   1. $GITHUB_TOKEN / $GH_TOKEN, when non-empty. They are exported-but-EMPTY in this container
#      (`remoteEnv` forwards a host variable the host does not set), so a `-z` test passes `set -u`
#      and yields no credential -- which is why emptiness, not definedness, is what is tested here.
#   2. The cache file, mode 0600, written by --bootstrap or --store-stdin.
#   3. Nothing: exit 3 with the command that fixes it. A missing credential is reported, never
#      prompted for.
#
# It is also a git credential helper (`get`/`store`/`erase`), so `git push` reads the same cache
# instead of raising a dialog. scripts/normalize-container-git-config.sh installs it for
# github.com in the container's ~/.gitconfig.

Usage: scripts/github-token.sh [command]

  (no command)     Print the cached token on stdout. Exit 3 when there is none.
  --check          Exit 0 when a token is available, 1 when not. Prints nothing.
  --path           Print the cache file path.
  --hosts          Print the URLs this cache is registered for, one per line.
  --store-stdin    Read a token from stdin and cache it. The prompt-free way to
                   supply a personal access token.
  --bootstrap      Ask the Dev Containers credential helper ONCE and cache the
                   answer. This raises a dialog on the owner's desktop, so it is
                   a deliberate human action and never something an agent runs.
  --erase          Delete the cached token.
  get|store|erase  git credential helper protocol (reads key=value on stdin).

Never echo the value: redirect it into a variable or a 0600 file.
