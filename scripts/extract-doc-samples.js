/**
 * Extracts the documentation samples a compiler can judge, so a compiler judges them.
 *
 * `lint:code-samples` pulls 3,061 C# blocks out of `docs/` and validates none of them
 * ([#611](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/611)), and
 * `lint-doc-identifiers.js` checks the two things a regex can check without lying: a namespace in a
 * `using`, an assembly name in a `link.xml`. Neither can see a MEMBER that moved, which was the
 * shape of every defect session 236 found by hand, including `AnalyzerRunner.RunAndExport`: a type
 * existing nowhere in the repository.
 *
 * A regex cannot close that gap. Measured on the real corpus, a first attempt keyed on
 * `Type.Member` reported `Serializer.ProtoDeserialize` as missing 17 times, because it cannot see a
 * generic method, an extension method, or an overload set, and a gate that cries wolf is one people
 * stop reading. So resolution is left to Roslyn: this script emits samples as compilation units and
 * `WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.DocSamplesCheck` compiles them against the real `Runtime/**`.
 *
 * WHICH BLOCKS, AND WHY A MARKER. Measured over the whole tree: 280 blocks are declaration-shaped,
 * and only 103 of them compile standing alone. The other 177 are continuations -- a subtype whose
 * base was declared in the block above, an inspector attribute on a field of a class the prose has
 * already introduced -- and they are correct documentation. A gate that failed two blocks in three
 * would be switched off inside a week, so a sample opts IN by saying it stands alone:
 *
 *     <!-- doc-sample: compiles -->
 *     ```csharp
 *     [WProtoContract]
 *     public partial class Player { [WProtoMember(1)] public int Level; }
 *     ```
 *
 * The marker is an HTML comment on its own line before the fence, invisible in rendered Markdown.
 * The checked COUNT is printed on every run, beside the total the tree holds, so a corpus that
 * stops being scanned is visible rather than silent -- and a run that marks nothing fails rather
 * than reporting a clean sweep of an empty set.
 *
 * TWO WRAPPER SHAPES, because documentation has two. A block that declares a type of its own goes
 * into a namespace; a block that is a set of MEMBERS goes onto a `MonoBehaviour`, which is what its
 * prose says it decorates. Wrapping every block in a namespace reported `[WShowIf(...)] public int
 * Shield;` as `CS0116`, which reads as the author's mistake and is the gate's.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = samples extracted, 1 = none were, or a marker is misplaced.
