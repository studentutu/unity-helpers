# Builds TestU01 from source and refuses to hand back a binary that cannot fail.
#
# Same contract as build-practrand.sh, and for the same reason: a statistical battery that reports
# "All tests were passed" is indistinguishable from one that is not testing anything, which is the
# failure class https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/556 is about. This
# script runs a generator whose weakness is already recorded in expected-outcomes.json and refuses
# to succeed unless TestU01 reports it.
#
# Two things that cost a build each and are therefore pinned here rather than rediscovered:
#
#   * The canonical download host `simul.iro.umontreal.ca` returns 404. The archive is served from
#     the author's directory, below.
#   * `make install` produces shared libraries, and a driver linked against them fails at run time
#     with `libtestu01.so.0: cannot open shared object file` unless LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set. The
#     driver is linked against the STATIC archives so the binary is self-contained, which is what a
#     CI leg and a developer's shell both want.
#   * The driver lives under `testu01~/` because **Unity compiles any `.c` it can see**. This
#     repository IS the package, so a `.c` anywhere under it is picked up as native plugin source
#     and handed to IL2CPP, which then fails the standalone player build on
#     `fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'bbattery.h'` and never produces
#     GameAssembly.dll. Measured: all four gated standalone legs, twice. A `~` suffix is the
#     directory Unity ignores, the same convention `Samples~` and `Generator~` use.
