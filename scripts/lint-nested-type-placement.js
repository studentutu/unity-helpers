/**
 * A nested type is declared at the END of its containing type, never between other members.
 *
 * The rule is the owner's, from review on #574: "Please place class/struct definitions at the end
 * of the file, or in their own file, do not intersperse with code." A reader scrolling a type for
 * a method should not have to step over a nested type to find it, and a type declaration in the
 * middle of a body reads as the start of a new file's worth of content. Recorded in
 * .llm/context.md (rule 6) and create-csharp-file (rule 5b); this is what stops it decaying (#575).
 *
 * Only the five declarations that OPEN A BODY are types for this purpose -- class, struct,
 * interface, record and enum. A `delegate` is a nested type too, but it is a single statement with
 * no body, so it cannot be the wall of content the rule is about.
 *
 * This tokenizes rather than greps, because the interesting words are not always declarations:
 *   * `where T : class` and `where T : struct` are constraints, not nested types.
 *   * `record` is contextual and is a perfectly good field or parameter name.
 *   * `[Attr(new[] { 1, 2 })]` puts a brace before the member's own body brace.
 *   * a field initializer -- `private int[] _a = { 1, 2 };` -- does the same.
 * Parameter lists, attribute sections and bracketed types are skipped as balanced spans, and
 * comments and string literals are masked to spaces first so a brace inside either cannot count.
 *
 * A member that does not sit wholly inside ONE conditional region is reported but never
 * rewritten. A member inside `#if UNITY_EDITOR` is compiled only there, so moving it past the
 * `#endif` changes which build sees it -- and a slice that carries an unbalanced `#if` lands the
 * directive mid-line, where C# refuses it outright. Two files in the #575 sweep hit exactly that.
 * Members are reordered only when every one of them opens and closes in the same region, which
 * leaves a conditional wholly inside a member (the common `#if UNITY_EDITOR` inside a method) free
 * to move with it.
 *
 * `--fix` moves each nested type to the end of its containing type body. The rewrite is a
 * PERMUTATION of exact source slices: every member carries its own leading trivia (doc comment,
 * attributes) and its trailing same-line comment, the slices tile the body with no gaps, and the
 * rewritten file is asserted to have the same length as the original before it is written. A fix
 * that changes a byte of anything other than order is a bug, and the length check is what says so.
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = clean (or every violation fixed), 1 = at least one violation remains.
