# Editor Tools Guide

**Batch tools for the asset work Unity makes you do one asset at a time.** Crop a folder of sprites,
build clips from a naming convention, apply one set of import settings to 400 textures, or find the
serialized field Unity is silently throwing away — 30+ editor tools in all.

Everything here lives under `Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers` unless stated otherwise. Two
tools also expose a public C# API you can drive from your own editor scripts:
[Texture Settings Applier](#texture-settings-applier) and
[Sprite Settings Applier](#sprite-settings-applier).

## Texture & Sprite Tools

### Image Blur Tool

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Image Blur`

You need a blurred copy of a background so the pause menu can sit on top of it without a render
texture. This applies a Gaussian blur to a batch of images and writes the results next to the
originals.

1. Drag your background textures (or the folder holding them) onto **Drag & Drop Images/Folders Here**.
2. Set **Blur Radius** — the slider runs `1` to `200`; `10` is a soft haze, `50` is a heavy frost.
3. Click **Apply Blur**.

Each source produces a new file beside it; the originals are left alone:

```text
Assets/UI/Backgrounds/
  pause_bg.png                 # untouched
  pause_bg_blurred_24.png      # written by the tool
```

`.jpg` and `.jpeg` sources stay JPEG; every other format is written as PNG. Re-running at the same
radius appends `_1`, `_2` and so on rather than overwriting.

The tool temporarily enables `Read/Write` and uses uncompressed import data while processing each
source. It restores both settings after that texture succeeds or fails, and shows one completion
summary for the whole batch. Small images and one-row or one-column passes avoid worker scheduling;
larger images retain parallel processing. The new blurred files are permanent project changes and
are not covered by Unity's undo history.

Editor scripts can blur an already readable texture without opening the window. `ImageBlurAPI.TryBlur`
returns a new texture owned by the caller; destroy it after encoding, saving, or displaying it:

```csharp
if (ImageBlurAPI.TryBlur(source, 12, out Texture2D blurred, out string error))
{
    try
    {
        // Use blurred here.
    }
    finally
    {
        UnityEngine.Object.DestroyImmediate(blurred);
    }
}
```

The API accepts radii from `1` through `200` and reports invalid or unreadable sources through
`error`. It does not change importer settings or write files.

For the same file output as the window, call `ImageBlurAPI.TryWriteAsset` with a project texture and
radius. It temporarily makes the source readable, restores its importer,
writes a uniquely named image beside it using the Unity project directory, and imports the result.
An occupied output name is preserved and the next numbered name is used, including when another
process creates the file while the blur is being written.
New output files are published from a complete staged image in the same directory. A failed
publication leaves the staged file for cleanup and does not expose a partial output. On Linux and
macOS, the output filesystem must support hard links; otherwise the API reports an error.
On Linux and macOS, if staged-file cleanup fails after publication, the API still imports the
output and returns its path, but returns `false` with the cleanup error.
This operation writes a file;
Unity Undo cannot remove that output file.

### Sprite Cropper

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Cropper`

Art tools export the whole canvas, so a 40-pixel-tall character often ships inside a 256x256 texture
that is mostly transparency. Sprite Cropper trims each texture to its alpha bounds, moves the pivot
so the sprite does not shift in the scene, and shrinks the 9-slice border by the same amount.
Padding a sprite that has no 9-slice border keeps that border at zero. When padding grows the
output beyond the source import size limit, the output limit grows to fit the new image.

1. Drop `Assets/Sprites/Characters` into **Input directories**.
2. Leave **Sprite Name Regex** at `.*`, or narrow it (`^player_`) to crop one character.
3. Set **Left/Right/Top/Bottom Padding** to `2` if a shader samples outside the sprite (outlines,
   glow); otherwise leave them at `0`.
4. Tick **Only Necessary** so already-tight sprites are skipped.
5. Click **Find Sprites To Process**, then **Process N Sprites**.

Results are written beside the source, or into **Output Directory** if you set one:

```text
Assets/Sprites/Characters/
  player_idle_0.png            # 256x256, mostly transparency
  Cropped_player_idle_0.png    # 48x64, same pivot, sits in the same place in-scene
```

**Overwrite Originals** writes in place instead.
Sprite Cropper stages each PNG before replacing its destination. A failed encoding or staging write
reports an error and keeps the previous image bytes. The final swap has the
[platform limits of `DurableFile`](../utilities/helper-utilities.md#durable-writes-for-player-data).

Editor scripts can call `SpriteCropperAPI.TryFind(inputFolders, spriteNameRegex, singlePaths,
multiPaths, out error)` with `Assets/...` folder paths. It returns project asset paths for
single-sprite images and reports multi-sprite sheets separately. The window uses this same
discovery path. Script paths may use backslashes or a differently cased `Assets` prefix; the API
normalizes them before asset lookup. `SpriteCropperAPI.Crop(assetPath, options)` crops one sprite with explicit padding,
destination, overwrite, readability, and platform-setting options, and returns the output path,
status, and any error. The window uses the same crop operation for each selected sprite.
`SpriteCropperAPI.TryBuildReplacementMap(folders, mapping, out error)` finds existing
`Cropped_*` pairs, and `SpriteCropperAPI.ReplaceReferences(folders, applyChanges)` previews or
applies reference changes across project assets. Both accept an optional output folder when
cropped files were written away from their sources. Replacement is only for separate `Cropped_*`
outputs; the Danger Zone button is disabled when **Overwrite Originals** is on. Script callers can
pass `overwriteOriginals: true` to make `ReplaceReferences` reject that combination.

**Before you run it:**

- Output is always PNG bytes. In overwrite mode a `.jpg` source keeps its `.jpg` name and holds PNG
  data.
- Only `Sprite Import Mode: Single` textures are cropped. Multi-sprite sheets are reported and
  skipped — run [Sprite Sheet Extractor](#sprite-sheet-extractor) first if you need them split.
- There is no undo, so commit before you run it.
- The collapsed **Danger Zone** at the bottom rewrites `.prefab`, `.unity`, `.asset`, `.mat`,
  `.anim` and `.overrideController` files to point at the `Cropped_*` sprites. It makes you tick "I
  understand the risks and want to proceed." first, and it is the one action here you cannot walk
  back without version control.

> **Visual Demo**
>
> ![Sprite Cropper showing original sprite with padding, then cropped result side-by-side](../../images/editor-tools/sprite-cropper-comparison.gif)
>
> _Before and after: transparent padding removed while preserving sprite content and pivot_

Cropping first also makes [Sprite Atlas Generator](#sprite-atlas-generator) pack tighter.
Crop output reuses dynamically sized pixel buffers, so repeated work does not retain one permanent
pool bucket for every texture size. Folder and file-extension filtering scans directly without
building temporary iterator chains during large asset searches.

### Texture Settings Applier

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Texture Settings Applier`

An artist drops 200 tiles into the project and every one arrives on Unity's defaults — bilinear
filtering on pixel art, mipmaps you do not want, 8192 max size. This window applies one set of
importer settings to every texture under a folder, with per-platform overrides.

1. Drag `Assets/Sprites/Tiles` into **Directory Sources** (or add individual textures under
   **Specific Textures**).
2. Tick **Apply Filter Mode** and choose `Point`; tick **Apply MipMaps** and leave
   **Generate MipMaps** off.
3. Under **Default Platform Settings**, set **Max Texture Size** to `2048` and **Compression** to
   `CompressedHQ`. That group has no apply toggles — whatever it shows is written.
4. Click **Calculate Stats** — it reports `Textures to process` and `Textures that will change`, and
   **Preview (N)** lists the first 200 paths.
5. Click **Apply Settings to Textures**.

Settings that tend to travel together:

| For                   | Filter Mode | Wrap Mode | Generate MipMaps | Compression    |
| --------------------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Pixel art and UI      | `Point`     | `Clamp`   | off              | `CompressedHQ` |
| Character sprites     | `Bilinear`  | `Clamp`   | off              | `CompressedHQ` |
| Tiling world textures | `Trilinear` | `Repeat`  | on               | `CompressedHQ` |

**Platform Overrides** adds an entry per platform (`Standalone`, `Android`, `iPhone`, `WebGL`,
`Switch`, ...). Each entry has its own apply toggles, so you can cap Android at `1024` while
Standalone keeps `2048`.

Nothing on disk is rewritten — only import settings — and the change is recorded as a single
`Apply Texture Settings` undo step. **Require Changes Before Apply** (on by default) skips the
reimport entirely when nothing would differ.

#### Applying texture settings from a script

The same logic is public, so a build step or a custom importer can use it directly:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles-editor -->

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Sprites;

public static class TileImportStandard
{
    public static void ApplyTo(string assetPath)
    {
        TextureSettingsApplierAPI.Config config = new()
        {
            applyFilterMode = true,
            filterMode = FilterMode.Point,
            applyMipMaps = true,
            generateMipMaps = false,
            applyPlatformMaxTextureSize = true,
            platformMaxTextureSize = 2048,
            platformOverrides = new[]
            {
                new TextureSettingsApplierAPI.PlatformOverride
                {
                    name = "Android",
                    applyMaxTextureSize = true,
                    maxTextureSize = 1024,
                },
            },
        };

        if (!TextureSettingsApplierAPI.WillTextureSettingsChange(assetPath, in config))
        {
            return;
        }

        if (
            TextureSettingsApplierAPI.TryUpdateTextureSettings(
                assetPath,
                in config,
                out TextureImporter importer
            )
        )
        {
            importer.SaveAndReimport();
        }
    }
}
```

`Config` is a struct with no defaults, so every field you care about must be set explicitly, and the
API never calls `SaveAndReimport()` for you — that is deliberate, so you can batch a whole folder
inside one `AssetDatabase.StartAssetEditing()` block. The default-platform name string is
`"DefaultTexturePlatform"`.

### Sprite Pivot Adjuster

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Pivot Adjuster`

A walk cycle where the character leans forward on some frames wobbles if every pivot is `(0.5, 0.5)`,
because the geometric center of the texture is not the visual center of the character. This computes
the center of pixels above the alpha cutoff and writes it as a custom pivot.

1. Add `Assets/Sprites/Characters/Player` to **Input Directories**.
2. Leave **Alpha Cutoff** at `0.01` so anti-aliased fringe pixels do not drag the pivot outward.
3. Leave **Skip Unchanged (fuzzy)** on — it avoids reimporting when the pivot moves less than
   `0.001`.
4. Click **Find Sprites To Process**, then **Dry Run** to see the counts, then
   **Adjust Pivots in Directory**.

Editor scripts can call `SpritePivotAdjusterAPI.TryFind(folders, nameRegex, paths, out error)`
with `Assets/...` folders, then call `SpritePivotAdjusterAPI.Run(paths, options)` to preview or
`Run(paths, options, applyChanges: true)` to apply. The result reports changes, skips, cancellation,
warnings, and errors. These calls normalize backslashes, trailing folder slashes, and the `Assets`
prefix casing. Invalid paths are counted as skipped and reported in the result errors. Neither call
opens the window.

Each changed importer is recorded as an `Adjust Sprite Pivot` undo step. The reimport side effect
may require regeneration after Undo.
Center-of-mass scans run directly below 65,536 pixels and for one-row sprites. Larger scans use
parallel row partitions, so small sprite batches avoid worker startup without slowing large art.
Folder and file-extension filtering also scans directly without per-file predicate allocations.

**Before you run it:**

- Single-sprite textures only.
- Textures without `Read/Write Enabled` are skipped, not fixed. Turn Read/Write on with
  [Texture Settings Applier](#texture-settings-applier) first.
- This window shares its remembered directory list with [Sprite Cropper](#sprite-cropper).

### Sprite Settings Applier

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Settings Applier`

Same idea as [Texture Settings Applier](#texture-settings-applier), but sprite-specific (pixels per
unit, pivot, sprite mode, extrude) and driven by _profiles_ — so `ui_` sprites can import at 100 PPU
with bilinear filtering while everything in `Assets/Sprites/World` imports at 16 PPU with point
filtering, in one pass.

1. Drag `Assets/Sprites` into **Directory Sources**.
2. Under **Sprite Settings Profiles**, add one profile per rule. Each has **Match By**
   (`Any`, `NameContains`, `PathContains`, `Regex`, `Extension`), **Match Pattern**, and a
   **Priority** — the highest matching priority wins.
3. Tick only the `Apply ...` toggles you want; each one reveals its value field.
4. **Calculate Stats**, then **Apply Settings to Sprites**.

**Save Profiles Asset** writes the rule set to a `SpriteSettingsProfileCollection` asset so the rest
of the team gets the same rules; **Load Profiles Asset** reads one back. There is no
`Assets > Create` entry for that asset — the button is how you make one.

Editor scripts can save and load the same profile assets without opening the window:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles-editor -->

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Sprites;

public static class SpriteProfilePersistenceExample
{
    public static List<SpriteSettings> SaveAndLoad()
    {
        List<SpriteSettings> profiles = new() { new SpriteSettings { name = "World" } };
        if (!SpriteSettingsApplierAPI.TrySaveProfiles(
                "Assets/Settings/SpriteProfiles.asset", profiles, false, out string error))
        {
            Debug.LogError(error);
            return profiles;
        }
        if (SpriteSettingsApplierAPI.TryLoadProfiles(
                "Assets/Settings/SpriteProfiles.asset", out List<SpriteSettings> loaded, out error))
        {
            return loaded;
        }
        Debug.LogError(error);
        return profiles;
    }
}
```

The path must be a `.asset` file in an existing folder under `Assets`. Saving refuses an occupied
path unless `overwriteExisting` is `true`, and never replaces an asset of another type. Saved and
loaded profiles are separate copies. A new save stages its asset and refuses a destination that
becomes occupied before the move. Overwrite refuses a file whose bytes changed before replacement.
Noncooperating external writers can still race with replacement or staging cleanup (tracked in #863). Asset
file writes and reimports cannot be fully reversed by Unity Undo; use version control to recover an
earlier saved asset. A failed save leaves its staged asset in place because another writer may have
changed it; check the reported path before retrying or removing it. If restoring an absent file
fails, the error also identifies the staged restore bytes for inspection.

#### Applying sprite settings from a script

<!-- doc-sample: compiles-editor -->

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Sprites;

public static class SpriteImportStandard
{
    private static readonly List<SpriteSettings> Profiles = new()
    {
        new SpriteSettings
        {
            matchBy = SpriteSettings.MatchMode.PathContains,
            matchPattern = "sprites/world",
            priority = 1,
            applyPixelsPerUnit = true,
            pixelsPerUnit = 16,
            applyFilterMode = true,
            filterMode = FilterMode.Point,
        },
        new SpriteSettings
        {
            matchBy = SpriteSettings.MatchMode.NameContains,
            matchPattern = "ui_",
            priority = 5,
            applyPixelsPerUnit = true,
            pixelsPerUnit = 100,
            applyFilterMode = true,
            filterMode = FilterMode.Bilinear,
        },
    };

    public static void ApplyTo(string assetPath)
    {
        List<SpriteSettingsApplierAPI.PreparedProfile> prepared =
            SpriteSettingsApplierAPI.PrepareProfiles(Profiles);

        if (!SpriteSettingsApplierAPI.WillTextureSettingsChange(assetPath, prepared))
        {
            return;
        }

        if (
            SpriteSettingsApplierAPI.TryUpdateTextureSettings(
                assetPath,
                prepared,
                out TextureImporter importer
            )
        )
        {
            importer.SaveAndReimport();
        }
    }
}
```

`PrepareProfiles` compiles the regexes once — hoist it out of the per-asset loop. `NameContains`
matches the file name, `PathContains` and `Regex` match the full asset path, and `Regex` is always
case-insensitive. Applying a `pivot` also forces `Sprite Alignment` to `Custom`.

### Texture Resizer

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Texture Resizer`

Scales PNGs up on disk. Reach for this when the source art is genuinely too small for the resolution
you ship at and you want the bigger pixels baked into the file rather than paid for at runtime.

1. Drag a folder into **Texture Source Paths**, or add textures to **Textures**.
2. Pick **Scaling Resize Algorithm**: `Point` for pixel art (no blur), `Bilinear` for everything
   else.
3. Set **Num Resizes** — each pass grows the texture by
   `width / (Pixels Per Unit * Width Multiplier)` (and the same for height), so several small passes
   scale more gently than one large one.
4. Tick **Dry Run** and click **Resize** — the console logs
   `[DryRun] Would resize <name> to [WxH]` for every match. This reads texture dimensions without
   resizing the loaded texture, reading pixel data, or changing importer settings.
5. Clear **Dry Run** and click **Resize** for real.

Editor scripts can call `TextureResizerAPI.TryResizeTextures` with selected textures, source
asset-folder paths, sizing settings, an optional output asset-folder path, and a dry-run flag. The
call does not open a window or ask for input. It returns `false` for invalid settings, a destination
collision, a failed resize, a failed importer restore, or cancellation. Pass `null` for the output
folder to overwrite the source PNGs; an empty string is invalid. For example, this Editor script
previews one asset folder:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles-editor -->

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Sprites;

public static class TextureResizeExample
{
    public static bool Preview()
    {
        return TextureResizerAPI.TryResizeTextures(
            null,
            new[] { "Assets/Art/Sprites" },
            1,
            TextureResizerWizard.ResizeAlgorithm.Point,
            100,
            1f,
            1f,
            "Assets/Art/Resized",
            true
        );
    }
}
```

Invalid source or output folders are rejected before any texture changes. Overwrite mode accepts
only textures under `Assets/`; package textures can be copied into an explicit `Assets/` output
folder. Textures are processed in natural name order, so `Sprite2` precedes `Sprite10`. The dry run reports target sizes without changing files or importer settings. A real run
writes PNG files, so Unity Undo cannot fully reverse it. A failed or canceled run may leave earlier
textures resized.

**Before you run it:**

- Only `.png` files are processed; anything else is counted as skipped.
- With **Output Folder** empty this **overwrites the originals in place** and there is no undo. Set
  **Output Folder** to write copies instead.
- Invalid sizing settings and output-name collisions are rejected before any source, importer, or
  destination file changes. Texture names are compared without regard to case because Unity asset
  paths must remain portable across project platforms.
- PNG writes are staged before replacement. A failed write reports an error rather than leaving
  a partly written PNG.
- A failed PNG encode reports an error and leaves the original image unchanged.
- If PNG encoding fails, the original image remains unchanged.
- The stock multipliers (`0.54` width, `0.245` height) grow a texture non-uniformly — a 128x128
  becomes 130x133 in one pass. Set both to the same value if you want a square scale.
- The final size is clamped to 16384 on each axis.

### Fit Texture Size

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Fit Texture Size`

Every texture in a fresh project imports at `Max Size: 2048`, whatever its real dimensions. A 64x64
icon wastes an import slot; a 4096-wide sky is silently halved. This reads each source file's actual
dimensions and sets `Max Size` to the power of two that fits.

Closing the window releases its serialized editor state; reopening binds fresh state.

1. Add `Assets/Sprites` to the source list (the window pre-fills it if that folder exists).
2. Choose a **Fit Mode**:

   | Mode             | Effect                                                        |
   | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `GrowAndShrink`  | Smallest power of two that fits the source. The usual choice. |
   | `GrowOnly`       | Raise `Max Size` when the source is bigger; never lower it.   |
   | `ShrinkOnly`     | Lower `Max Size` to the tightest fit; never raise it.         |
   | `RoundToNearest` | Nearest power of two to the source size, ties rounding up.    |

3. Narrow the run if you want to: **Only Current Selection**, **Only Sprites**, **Name Filter**
   (substring, or a regex with **Use Regex**), **Label Filter (CSV)**.
4. Set **Min Allowed Size** / **Max Allowed Size** to keep results inside a range (defaults `32` and
   `8192`).
5. Click **Calculate Potential Changes**. You get
   `N textures would be modified ... Grows: G, Shrinks: S, Unchanged: U`.
6. Click **Run Fit Texture Size**.

A 1920x1080 source under `GrowAndShrink` lands on `2048`; a 64x64 source under `ShrinkOnly` lands on
`64`.

Import settings only, recorded as a `Fit Texture Size` undo step per asset, and cancellable from the
progress bar. **Apply to Standalone / Android / iOS** additionally writes a platform override with
the same size. **Fit Mode** is not persisted across a domain reload — re-select it after a
recompile.

Scripts and batch-mode jobs can run the same operation without opening the window:

```csharp
List<string> textureGuids = new();
if (FitTextureSizeAPI.TryFindTextures(new[] { "Assets/Sprites" }, true, textureGuids, out string error))
{
    FitTextureSizeAPI.Options options = new() { FitMode = FitMode.GrowAndShrink, OnlySprites = true };
    FitTextureSizeAPI.Result preview = FitTextureSizeAPI.Run(textureGuids, options, false);
    if (!preview.Succeeded)
    {
        Debug.LogError(preview.Error);
    }
    else if (preview.Changed > 0)
    {
        FitTextureSizeAPI.Result applied = FitTextureSizeAPI.Run(textureGuids, options, true);
        if (!applied.Succeeded)
        {
            Debug.LogError(applied.Error);
        }
    }
}
else
{
    Debug.LogError(error);
}
```

`Run` reports counts, cancellation, and errors; a failed apply may report partial changes. Import
settings writes and reimports cannot be fully reversed by Unity Undo alone. Supply explicit asset
paths or GUIDs instead of relying on the current editor selection.

## Animation Tools

### Sprite Animation Editor (Animation Viewer Window)

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Animation Editor`

Unity's Animation window is built for curves, and reordering four sprite keyframes in it is more work
than it should be. This opens a clip as a list of frames you can drag, with the animation playing
next to it.

1. Click **Browse Clips (Multi)...** and pick `PlayerWalk.anim` (and any other clips you want open at
   the same time).
2. Click the clip in the left panel to make it active. The preview starts playing immediately.
3. Drag a frame in the **Frames** panel to move it, or type a new position into its **Order:** field
   and press Enter.
4. Set **Preview FPS** and click **Apply Preview FPS** to see the new speed.
5. Click **Save Active Clip**.

The **Preview FPS** field works in Unity 2021.3 and later supported editors.

**Before you save:** saving writes the preview FPS onto the clip and re-spaces every keyframe to
match. That is usually what you want after changing the speed of a walk cycle, but it means you cannot save a
reorder while leaving the original timing alone.

Editor scripts can update an existing clip without opening the window:

```csharp
bool saved = AnimationClipFrameSaveAPI.TrySaveFrames(
    clip,
    new[] { idle0, idle1, idle2 },
    12f,
    "Character",
    out bool usedFallbackBinding,
    out string error
);
```

The preferred path selects a `SpriteRenderer` sprite curve; an empty string selects a curve on the
root object. If the path is absent, the method uses the first sprite curve and sets
`usedFallbackBinding`. Pass `null` to select the first curve without a path preference. The method
requires a standalone `.anim` asset, rejects invalid frames or FPS before editing, preserves other
curves, events, and clip settings, records Undo, and saves the clip asset. Undo restores the clip in
memory; the asset write itself is not fully reversible through Unity Undo.

This is an editor for frame _order_ and _speed_. Adding or removing frames is
[Animation Creator](#animation-creator)'s job; the `X` next to a loaded clip closes it in this window
rather than deleting anything. One clip previews at a time.

### Animation Creator

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Animation Creator`

An artist hands you `Player_Idle_0.png` through `Player_Attack_11.png` — sixty files, eight
animations. Making those clips by hand is an hour of dragging, and Unity's default sort puts frame 10
before frame 2. This groups the sprites by name and writes the clips.

1. Add `Assets/Sprites/Player` as a source folder.
2. Leave **Sprite Name Regex** at `.*`, or narrow it (`^Player_Attack`) to build one clip.
3. Click **Generate Auto-Parse Preview** to see the groups it found before anything is created.
4. Click **Auto-Parse Matched Sprites into Animations**. You get one entry per group under
   **Animation Data**.
5. Set **FPS** and **Loop** per clip.
6. Click **Create Animations**.

These naming patterns are detected without any configuration:

```text
Player_Idle_0.png,  Player_Idle_1.png     -> Player_Idle,  frames 0..N
slime-walk-01.png,  slime-walk-02.png     -> slime-walk,   frames 1..N
Mage/Attack (0).png, Mage/Attack (1).png  -> Attack,       frames 0..N
```

`@2x` density suffixes are stripped before grouping.

If your files do not fit any of those, tick **Enable Custom Group Regex** and supply one with `base`
and `index` named groups. Use the **Regex Tester** box to check it against a real file name before
applying:

```text
^(?<base>.*?)(?:_|\s|-)?(?<index>\d+)$    # base plus trailing digits
^Enemy_(?<base>Walk)_(?<index>\d+)$        # only Enemy_Walk_N
```

**Where clips land:** each clip is written next to the first sprite in its group, with a unique name.
There is no output folder picker — use [Animation Copier](#animation-copier) to move a generated set
into `Assets/Animations`.

Editor scripts can call `AnimationCreatorAPI.TryCreateClip(data, frames, out clip, out error)` to
build a clip in the supplied frame order without writing an asset. Call
`AnimationCreatorAPI.TryCreateAsset(data, out path, out error)` to ignore null frames, naturally
sort the remaining sprites, and save a uniquely named `.anim` beside the first sprite. The
sprite must already be an asset under `Assets`. When creating several clips inside an
`AssetDatabaseBatchHelper` scope, pass `saveAssets: false` and call `AssetDatabase.SaveAssets()`
after the batch.
If saving fails after asset creation, `TryCreateAsset` returns `false` with the created path so the
caller can inspect or remove it.

**Also worth knowing:**

- **Prefix Leaf Folder Name** / **Prefix Full Folder Path** keep `Idle` from four different
  characters from colliding, and **Resolve Duplicate Animation Names** (on by default) renames any
  that still do.
- Frames are ordered by Unity's natural sort at creation time, so `2` sorts before `10`.
- **Framerate Mode** is `Constant` (one FPS, the default at `12`) or `Curve`, where an
  `AnimationCurve` drives FPS across the clip — the **Flat / Ease In / Ease Out / Sync** buttons give
  you a starting shape. Use `Curve` for an attack that snaps and then holds.
- **Preview** plays a clip entry before you create anything.
- **Configuration Persistence** saves the whole window state to `.animation-creator.json` in a source
  folder, so the next person to import that folder gets your settings. A staging failure keeps the
  previous config; on platforms without `File.Replace`, a failed fallback swap can still lose it.

Next: adjust the results in [Sprite Animation Editor](#sprite-animation-editor-animation-viewer-window),
or add events with [Animation Event Editor](#animation-event-editor).

### Animation Copier

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Animation Copier`

[Animation Creator](#animation-creator) leaves clips beside their sprites, but you keep clips in
`Assets/Animations`. Re-running it after an art update produces a mix of genuinely new clips,
genuinely changed clips, and dozens that are byte-for-byte what you already have. This tells the three
apart and moves only what matters.

1. Set **Source Path** (defaults to `Assets/Sprites`) and **Destination Path** (defaults to
   `Assets/Animations`).
2. Click **Analyze Source & Destination**.
3. Read the counts: **- New:**, **- Changed:**, **- Unchanged (Duplicates):**.
4. Expand **New** and **Changed** to review, using **Filter** (plus **Regex**) and
   **Select All** / **Select None** to pick what moves.
5. Tick **Dry Run (no changes)** and run the copy once to see what it would do.
6. Clear it, then click **Copy New (N)** or **Copy Changed (N)**.

Dry runs leave destination files and folders untouched, including subfolders that a real copy would
create for nested source clips.

Scripts and batch jobs can use `AnimationCopierAPI.TryAnalyze` with explicit source and destination
folders to receive source entries and destination orphans. Pass selected source paths to `Run` for
`CopyNew`, `CopyChanged`, `CopyAll`, or `DeleteUnchangedSource`; pass selected destination paths
for `DeleteDestinationOrphans`. Set `applyChanges: false` to preview eligible operations and
`applyChanges: true` to perform them. The result reports processed, skipped, and failed counts,
cancellation, and per-path diagnostics. The API makes no prompts, rechecks each selected clip before
an operation, accepts standalone `.anim` files under distinct non-overlapping `Assets` folders,
and never creates folders during a preview.

Copying a changed clip preserves its GUID, so every Animator that already references it keeps
working.

Enable **Include Unchanged in Copy All (force replace)** when you need to refresh selected clips
that the last analysis classified as unchanged. **Copy All** then replaces those destination files
too and preserves their GUIDs.

"Changed" is decided by comparing clip contents field by field — frame rate, length, wrap mode, every
curve key, every event and its parameters — not by an asset hash, so a re-import that produces an
identical clip does not show up as a change.

**Cleanup** is where the destructive buttons live: **Delete N Unchanged Source Duplicates** removes
the redundant copies left behind in the source folder, and
**Mirror Delete Destination Orphans (N)** deletes destination clips with no source any more. Both
honour **Dry Run**. **Export Preview Report** writes the analysis to a file if you would rather review
it outside the editor. The complete report is staged before replacing an existing file. Copy, delete, and reimport operations change files on disk and cannot be
fully reversed through Unity Undo.

### Sprite Sheet Animation Creator

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Sheet Animation Creator`

Your character is one `hero.png` sliced into 48 sprites in the Sprite Editor, and frames 0-7 are the
idle, 8-15 the run, 16-23 the attack. This lets you select those ranges visually and turn each into a
clip.

1. Assign the sliced texture to **Sprite Sheet**, or click **Load Sprites** and pick the file.
2. Drag across the thumbnails to select frames 0-7.
3. Click **Add Animation Definition**. Name it `Hero_Idle`.
4. Set **Default FPS:**, **Looping:** and **Cycle Offset:**, then hit **Preview This** and use
   **▶ Play** to check it.
5. Repeat for the run and attack ranges — the **Start Idx:** / **End Idx:** fields let you correct a
   selection by hand.
6. Click **Generate Animation Files** and choose an output folder.

**FPS Curve:** takes an `AnimationCurve` instead of a flat rate, so an attack can hold on its impact
frame. The curve changes how far apart keyframes are placed; the generated clip's own frame rate is
always 60, which is what lets fractional timings land cleanly.

Editor scripts can call `SpriteSheetAnimationAPI.TryCreate(outputFolder, name, frames,
defaultFrameRate, frameRateCurve, loop, cycleOffset, dryRun, out assetPath, out error)` with ordered
sprite frames and an `Assets/` output folder or an existing `Packages/` folder. It generates a
unique `.anim` name and normalizes the `Assets` prefix casing. Set `dryRun: true`
to preview the path without creating folders or assets. A successful creation saves the asset;
Unity Undo cannot reverse the file write. For several clips, pass `saveAssets: false` and call
`AssetDatabase.SaveAssets()` once after the batch. If saving fails after creation, the call returns
`false` and retains the created asset path in `assetPath` so the caller can inspect or remove it.

The texture must already be sliced (`Sprite Mode: Multiple`) — this window reads Unity's sprites, it
does not slice for you.

### Sprite Sheet Extractor

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Sheet Extractor`

The reverse of the tool above: take a packed sheet and write each sprite out as its own PNG. Needed
whenever something downstream wants files rather than sub-assets — a third-party animation tool, or
[Sprite Cropper](#sprite-cropper), which only handles single-sprite textures.

1. Add the folder holding your sheets to **Input Directories**.
2. Pick a **Mode**:

   | Mode             | Use when                                                                      |
   | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `FromMetadata`   | The sheet is already sliced in Unity. Keeps names, rects, pivots and borders. |
   | `GridBased`      | Even cells. Set **Columns**/**Rows** or leave **Grid Size Mode** on `Auto`.   |
   | `PaddedGrid`     | Even cells with gutters. Set **Left/Right/Top/Bottom** padding.               |
   | `AlphaDetection` | Sprites are scattered irregularly. Tune **Alpha Threshold** (default `0.01`). |

3. Click **Find Sprite Sheets**, then **Preview Slicing** to see the detected rects drawn over the
   texture (**Show Overlay**).
4. Choose a **Pivot Mode** — `Center`, the eight edge and corner presets, or `Custom` with explicit
   **X** / **Y**.
5. Set **Output Directory**, then click **Extract N Sprite(s)**.

Scripts and batch jobs can call `SpriteSheetExtractionAPI.Extract` with explicit source and output
asset paths, a pixel rectangle, normalized pivot, and border. The output folder must already exist
under `Assets` or a writable local `Packages` path. The API returns extracted and skipped counts
plus errors, and never opens a window or displays a prompt. Set `dryRun: true` to preview the count
without changing files or importers.
With the default `overwriteExisting: false`, an output that appears during extraction is skipped
and left unchanged. With `overwriteExisting: true`, the encoded PNG is staged before replacing the
existing file. New outputs are published from a complete staged image in the same directory.
Extraction attempts to remove its temporary file if publishing fails; a failed publication does not
expose a partial new output. On Linux and macOS, the output filesystem must support hard links.
If temporary-file cleanup fails, the result reports that error alongside the extraction failure.
On Linux and macOS, if cleanup fails after publication, the result still counts and imports the
output and includes the cleanup error in `Errors`.

Use `SpriteSheetExtractionAPI.Discover` with folder asset paths and an optional filename regex to
get the same sprite texture list as the window. Its result includes warnings for invalid folders
and an error for an invalid or timed-out regex.

`SpriteSheetReferenceReplacementAPI.Run` accepts an explicit map from source sprites to extracted
sprites and explicit asset paths. It previews matching references by default; pass
`applyChanges: true` to write them. The window uses this API after its Danger Zone confirmation.
Unity records object changes for Undo, but saved asset edits should still be protected by version
control.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles-editor -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Sprites;

SpriteSheetExtractionRequest request = new(
    "Assets/Sprites/characters.png",
    "Assets/Extracted/hero.png",
    new Rect(0, 0, 32, 32),
    new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f),
    Vector4.zero
);
SpriteSheetExtractionResult result = SpriteSheetExtractionAPI.Extract(new[] { request });
```

**Auto-detection:** with **Grid Size Mode** on `Auto`, the **Algorithm** dropdown picks how cell size
is inferred: `AutoBest` (tries each and stops once one reaches 90% confidence), `UniformGrid`,
`BoundaryScoring`, `ClusterCentroid`, `DistanceTransform` or `RegionGrowing`. Filling in
**Expected Sprite Count** dramatically improves the result, and **Snap to Divisor** keeps the cell
size an exact divisor of the texture.

Alpha detection rejects `NaN` and infinite thresholds without producing sprite bounds or a grid.
Transparency-based grid detection requires a threshold in `[0, 1)`.

**Also worth knowing:**

- **Dry Run** turns the extract button into `Dry Run: Preview N Sprite(s)` and writes nothing.
- Per-sheet settings override the global ones; **Apply Global to All** pushes yours down, and
  **Save Config** writes a `<texture>.spritesheet.json` beside the sheet so a re-extraction is
  reproducible. A staging failure keeps the previous config; on platforms without `File.Replace`, a
  failed fallback swap can still lose it. A `Config Stale` badge appears when the texture has changed
  since.
- **Preserve Import Settings** (on by default) copies the source's importer settings to each output.
- Preview and extracted output reuse dynamically sized pixel buffers instead of retaining one
  permanent pool bucket for every sprite size.
- The **Danger Zone: Reference Replacement** section points existing assets at the extracted
  sprites. Like the one in Sprite Cropper, it requires ticking
  "I understand the risks and want to proceed." and it is not undoable.

---

### Animation Event Editor

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > AnimationEvent Editor`

Editor scripts can save events without opening the window. Call
`AnimationEventSaveAPI.TrySave(clip, events, frameRate, out error)` with an explicit clip and event
array. Pass `null` for `frameRate` to keep the clip's current rate. The call records Unity Undo,
marks the clip dirty, and saves the asset. It returns `false` with an error for invalid input or a
failed save. Unity Undo covers clip changes; external asset save side effects may not be fully
reversible.

Putting a footstep sound on frame 4 of a run cycle in Unity's Animation window means finding the
right time value and typing a method name from memory. This shows the sprite at each event, lists the
methods that are actually callable, and edits the parameter with the right field type.

Animation Creator and Animation Event Editor retain at most 128 sprite previews per window,
within a 32 MiB estimated texture-storage budget. The estimate includes mip levels, CPU/GPU copies
and a per-texture allowance; it is not a measurement of total editor or driver memory. Recently
used previews stay cached, and Unity-destroyed previews are rebuilt when needed.

Changing clips or closing Animation Event Editor releases copied previews. Eviction releases only
textures the window created; Unity's shared previews remain owned by Unity. A readable sprite too
large to copy within the budget is drawn directly from its source rectangle at the same resolution.
A failed preview copy releases its temporary texture.

First, mark the methods you want to fire:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public enum Stance { Idle, Crouched, Guarding }

public sealed class PlayerAnimationEvents : MonoBehaviour
{
    [AnimationEvent]
    public void PlayFootstep() { }

    [AnimationEvent]
    public void SpawnSlashVfx(string socketName) { }

    [AnimationEvent]
    public void EnableHitbox(int hitboxIndex) { }

    [AnimationEvent]
    public void SetStance(Stance stance) { }
}
```

Then:

1. Drag the GameObject holding the `Animator` into **Animator Object**.
2. Pick the clip from **Animation** (use **Animation Search** to filter a long list).
3. Type `4` into **FrameIndex** and click **Add Event**.
4. Choose **TypeName** `PlayerAnimationEvents`, then **MethodName** `PlayFootstep`.
5. Click **Save**.

**Method signatures Unity accepts** — and therefore the only ones this window lists — return `void`
and take either no parameter or exactly one of: `int`, `float`, `string`, `UnityEngine.Object`, or an
enum. `UnityEngine.Object` means that exact type; a method taking `GameObject` or `Sprite` will not
appear.

**Explicit Mode** is on by default and lists only `[AnimationEvent]` methods, which is what keeps the
dropdown readable in a real project. Turn it off to see every signature-valid method on every
`MonoBehaviour` (private ones included) and use **Type Search** / **Method Search** to narrow.

By default an `[AnimationEvent]` method is offered on its declaring class only. Use
`[AnimationEvent(ignoreDerived = false)]` when subclasses should offer it too.

**Also worth knowing:**

- **Control Frame Time** off (the default) means you work in whole frames; on, you edit the raw time
  value.
- The sprite preview needs `Read/Write Enabled` on the texture. When it is missing you get a **Fix**
  button that turns it on.
- **Move Up** / **Move Down** swap events that sit at the same time; **Re-Order** sorts everything by
  time. **Duplicate** copies an event, and **Reset** reverts to the last saved state.
- The Save / Reset / Re-Order row only appears once you have unsaved changes; otherwise the window
  says `No changes detected...`.
- Shortcuts: `Delete` removes the focused event, `Ctrl+D` duplicates it, arrow keys navigate. The
  duplicate shortcut is `Ctrl` only, including on macOS.

## Sprite Atlas Tools

### Sprite Atlas Generator

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Sprite Atlas Generator`

A `.spriteatlas` asset holds a hand-maintained list of sprites, so every new sprite an artist adds is
one someone has to remember to drag in. This drives the atlas from a rule instead — a regex, an asset
label, or both — and rescans on demand.

Project changes rebuild the serialized editor state and drop removed configurations from the
foldout cache while preserving surviving scan results. Refreshes sort configurations in place, and
source-sprite checks reuse temporary storage, so large atlas lists do not build query pipelines.
Closing the window releases its cached state.

1. Click **Create New Config in 'Assets/Data'**. That makes a `ScriptableSpriteAtlas` asset (you can
   also use `Assets > Create > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Scriptable Sprite Atlas Config`).
2. Set **Output Sprite Atlas Directory** and **Output Sprite Atlas Name** — the atlas is written to
   `<directory>/<name>.spriteatlas`.
3. Click **Add New Source Folder Entry** and point it at `Assets/Sprites/Characters`.
4. Choose how sprites are selected:

   | Selection Mode    | What it matches                                                                               |
   | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `Regex`           | Every pattern in **Regexes (AND logic)** must match the asset path.                           |
   | `Labels`          | Asset labels, combined by **Label Selection Mode**: `All` (every label) or `AnyOf` (any one). |
   | `Regex \| Labels` | Both, joined by **Regex & Tags Logic** (`And` / `Or`).                                        |

5. Click **Scan Folders for '<config name>'**. New folder entries start with Regex selection and no
   patterns, so they include sprites until you narrow them. The window reports `To Add: N sprites.` and
   `To Remove: N sprites.` before anything changes.
6. Click **Sync List To Scan Result (N add, N remove)**.
7. Click **Generate/Update '<name>.spriteatlas' ONLY**, then **Pack All Generated Sprite Atlases** —
   or **Generate + Pack** to do both.

Scripts and batch jobs can use the same configuration without opening the window. Call
`ScriptableSpriteAtlasGenerator.Scan(config, toAdd, toRemove)` to preview folder changes, then
`Synchronize(config, toAdd, toRemove)` to add found sprites while keeping existing manual entries.
If a source folder or filter is invalid, `Scan` returns `false` with empty results; fix the config
before synchronizing.
Pass `removeUnmatchedSprites: true` to remove every sprite absent from the scanned folders, including
manual entries. The window's **Sync List To Scan Result** button uses that removal mode. `Generate(config)` writes one atlas
and returns whether it changed; `GenerateAll()` writes all configured atlases in one asset batch and
returns the number changed, or `-1` if any config failed. `TryGenerateAll(out changed)` also reports
whether every config was valid.
`PackAll(target)` packs for a chosen build target. A CI check can call
`TryFindDrift(config, differences)` and fail if it returns `false` or adds any differences. It checks
packables and generated settings without changing the atlas. To regenerate and pack in Unity batch
mode, use `-executeMethod WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Sprites.ScriptableSpriteAtlasGenerator.GenerateAndPackAllForBatch`.
That command skips packing and exits with code 1 if a config has an invalid or occupied output path.
Generation and packing write assets and may trigger imports; Unity Undo cannot reverse all file and
import effects.

A character atlas that picks up every new idle frame automatically:

```text
Folder Path:          Assets/Sprites/Characters
Selection Mode:       Regex
Regexes (AND logic):  ["player_", "_idle_"]
Max Texture Size:     2048
Padding:              4
Compression:          CompressedHQ
```

A UI atlas driven by labels, so artists opt sprites in from the Inspector rather than by filename:

```text
Folder Path:            Assets/Sprites/UI
Selection Mode:         Labels
Label Selection Mode:   AnyOf
Labels:                 ["icon", "hud"]
Max Texture Size:       1024
Padding:                2
```

The **Labels** fields are dropdowns populated from every label in the project — see
[Sprite Label Processor](#sprite-label-processor) for what keeps that list current.

**Also worth knowing:**

- Each source folder entry has an exclusion block — **Exclude Regexes (OR logic)**,
  **Exclude Labels** and **Exclude Path Prefixes** — for keeping work-in-progress or reference art out of a
  shipped atlas.
- **Platform Overrides** on the config set per-platform max size and compression for Standalone,
  iPhone and Android independently.
- **Force Uncompressed for N Source Sprites in '<config>'** sets the _source_ sprites to uncompressed
  so the packer has full-quality input. It asks for confirmation first, and it changes those source
  assets.
- Regex matching is case-insensitive. A pattern that fails to compile is logged and matches nothing.

## Validation & Quality Tools

<a id="asset-validation"></a>

### Asset Validation

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Asset Validation`

A dockable window over your own project checks. Write an `IValidationRule` -- "every enemy prefab has
a spawn point", "no `AudioClip` is set to Decompress On Load" -- and this runs them across the whole
project a few milliseconds per editor tick, rather than freezing for thirty seconds.

1. Click **Validate Project**. A counter beside the button shows progress; the button becomes
   **Cancel**.
2. Findings are colored by severity. Click one to select and ping the asset.
3. Narrow the list: the search box matches the rule, path, discriminator and message; **At least**
   cycles the severity floor through Info, Warning and Error; **Show suppressed** is on by default.
4. **Suppress Selected** appends the finding to `ValidationSuppressions.txt`, the same file the
   headless run reads.

Tick **Re-check on import** and an import re-validates only the assets it touched. It is off by
default and stored per user, because whether the cost is worth paying is a fact about a workstation
rather than about a repository.

The summary line distinguishes **nothing checked yet** from **checked, and clean** -- an empty list
alone would report a project as healthy on the strength of never having looked at it.

Writing rules, the headless `-executeMethod` run, and the suppression file format are covered in
[Asset Validation](./asset-validation.md).

### Prefab Checker

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Prefab Checker`

Someone deletes a script, and forty prefabs quietly acquire a "Missing (Mono Script)" slot that only
shows up when a scene loads. Prefab Checker walks every prefab under a folder and logs the problems
with clickable links.

1. Click **Add Folder** and pick `Assets/Prefabs` (already added for you if that folder exists).
2. Leave the default checks on and click **Run Checks**.
3. Click a console line to select the offending prefab.

| Check                            | Reports                                                     | Default |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Missing Scripts**              | Components whose script asset is gone                       | On      |
| **Nulls in Lists/Arrays**        | `null` elements inside a serialized list or array           | On      |
| **Missing Required Components**  | A `[RequireComponent]` dependency that is not on the prefab | On      |
| **Null Object References**       | Unassigned `UnityEngine.Object` fields                      | On      |
| **Only if [ValidateAssignment]** | Narrows the check above to annotated fields only            | On      |
| **Disabled Root GameObject**     | Prefab roots saved inactive                                 | On      |
| **Empty String Fields**          | Serialized `string` fields left empty                       | Off     |
| **Disabled Components**          | `Behaviour` components saved disabled                       | Off     |

Everything except **Empty String Fields** is logged as an error; empty strings are warnings.

Editor scripts can scan without opening the window. Pass project-relative folder paths and explicit
options to `PrefabChecker.ScanFolders`; the returned result includes counts, any input error, and
findings grouped by prefab path. This call shows no dialogs, records no folder history, and makes no
asset changes. It uses the same default checks as the window; set the options you need before the
call. The window still logs findings and can export its last report.

```csharp
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor;

PrefabChecker.ScanOptions options = new PrefabChecker.ScanOptions
{
    CheckDisabledComponents = true,
};
PrefabChecker.ScanResult result = PrefabChecker.ScanFolders(
    new[] { "Assets/Prefabs" },
    options
);
if (result.Error == null)
{
    foreach (PrefabChecker.ScanReport.Item item in result.Report.items)
    {
        UnityEngine.Debug.Log($"{item.path}: {string.Join("; ", item.messages)}");
    }
}
```

**Narrowing a run:** **Include Labels (comma)** and **Exclude Labels (comma)** filter by asset label,
and **Deny Component Types (comma names)** skips those component types during checks
(a debug-only behaviour, say).

**Fixing and reporting:** **Fix Missing Scripts** strips dead component slots, but it stays disabled
until you tick **Enable Auto-fix options** — the gate is deliberate, because the fix deletes data.
**Export Report (JSON)** and **Export Report (CSV)** write the same findings to a file for a build
step or a review. The complete report is staged before replacing an existing file.

Annotate the fields you actually care about so the null check stays useful:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public sealed class Turret : MonoBehaviour
{
    [ValidateAssignment]
    public Transform muzzle;

    [ValidateAssignment]
    public GameObject projectilePrefab;

    // Not annotated: optional, and a null here is not a bug.
    public AudioClip idleHum;
}
```

### Analyzer Policies

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Analyzer Policies`

Use this window to make the package's compiler guidance explicit for scripts under `Assets`:

- **Enable All** writes every `WUH001` through `WUH018` rule as `Warning`.
- **Disable All** writes every rule as `None`, including diagnostics that are on by default.
- **Refresh** re-reads `Assets/Default.ruleset` and reports missing, duplicate, mixed, malformed, or
  unknown Unity Helpers policy entries.

The tool preserves rule groups owned by other analyzers. It refuses malformed XML instead of
overwriting it. Ruleset writes are staged before replacement, and failures are reported without
leaving a partly written ruleset. The ruleset is a project file change outside Unity's undo system,
so commit it when the policy should be shared with the team. The window lists every diagnostic
with a short explanation; the [Analyzer reference](../../performance/analyzers.md) has examples and
fixes.

### Unity Method Analyzer

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Unity Method Analyzer`

A `private void Start()` in a subclass whose base class also has `private void Start()` compiles
cleanly, and Unity calls only one of them. Roslyn reports that family of mistake during compilation; this window presents the compiler diagnostics.

1. Compile the project, then select `Assets/Scripts` in the report directories.
2. Click **Refresh Report**; use **Recompile Scripts** when a fresh compiler snapshot is needed.
3. Double-click a result to jump to the line.

| It finds                    | Example                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A missing `override`        | A derived method hiding the base one instead of overriding it                  |
| A wrong lifecycle signature | `OnCollisionEnter(Collider c)` where Unity calls `OnCollisionEnter(Collision)` |
| A shadowed lifecycle method | Base and derived both declare `private void Start()`                           |
| A static lifecycle method   | `static void Awake()`, which Unity never calls                                 |

Results group by file, severity or category, and export as JSON or Markdown. Editor scripts can use
`UnityMethodAnalyzerReportExportAPI.TryExportMarkdown` or `TryExportJson` with explicit findings,
coverage status, and output path. The status identifies missing coverage or compiler errors; an
empty partial report is not a passing CI gate.

Silence a deliberate case — a test fixture that exists precisely to be wrong — with
`[SuppressAnalyzer]`:

```csharp
[SuppressAnalyzer("Test fixture for analyzer validation")]
public sealed class DeliberatelyShadowedStart : BaseBehaviour
{
    private void Start() { }
}
```

### Serialized Field Validator

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Validate Serialized Fields In Selection`

Unity declines to serialize some types and declines silently. Select the script and run the command;
it names every field that will be empty after the next domain reload, and what to use instead.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
public sealed class Loot : ScriptableObject
{
    public Dictionary<string, int> drops;   // gone on the next domain reload
    public (int, float) weightedRoll;       // gone, and it IS [Serializable]
}
```

`SerializedObject.FindProperty("drops")` returns `null`, `JsonUtility.ToJson` omits the field, and
nothing is logged. Whatever a designer authored into it is gone, usually discovered from a build.
`[Serializable]` is not the discriminator, which is what makes the rule hard to work out from
outside: `ValueTuple<int, float>` carries it and is dropped anyway.

The console tells you the fix:

```text
Loot.drops is declared as Dictionary<string, int>, which Unity does not serialize. Anything
authored into it is gone on the next domain reload. Use SerializableDictionary<string, int>
instead.
```

| Declared as                             | Use instead                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`              | `SerializableDictionary<TKey, TValue>`       |
| `SortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`        | `SerializableSortedDictionary<TKey, TValue>` |
| `HashSet<T>`                            | `SerializableHashSet<T>`                     |
| `SortedSet<T>`                          | `SerializableSortedSet<T>`                   |
| `Nullable<T>`                           | `SerializableNullable<T>`                    |
| `ValueTuple<...>`, `Tuple<...>`         | `SerializableValueTuple<...>`                |
| `KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>`            | `SerializableValueTuple<TKey, TValue>`       |
| `Queue<T>`, `Stack<T>`, `LinkedList<T>` | `List<T>`                                    |

**How it decides:** it constructs the type, wraps it in a `SerializedObject`, and asks which fields
arrived. That is Unity's own answer rather than a model of its rules, so it cannot misreport the
generic user types Unity has serialized since 2020. Every `public` or `[SerializeField]` field with
no `SerializedProperty` is reported, inherited ones included.

**Silencing a field:** mark it `[NonSerialized]`. That is the standard way to say "runtime only",
Unity honours it, and so does this.

**Why the selection and not the whole project:** validating a type means constructing one, and
constructing every type in a project runs the startup half of the project. Select what you just
wrote — a `MonoScript`, a prefab, a scene object or an asset. A prefab contributes every component on
it.

---

## Custom Component Editors

### MatchColliderToSprite Editor

`MatchColliderToSprite` reshapes a `PolygonCollider2D` through its synchronous `RebuildCollider()`
command. Inspector edits and the **MatchColliderToSprite** button run that command with a
`Match Collider To Sprite` undo step for the component and selected collider, including prefab
overrides. Its runtime update loop also rebuilds when the sprite or trace settings change.

Editor `OnValidate()` only resolves component references. Editor tools that previously called it to
regenerate geometry must call `RebuildCollider()` and record Undo for both objects first. This keeps
Undo/Redo validation from replacing the polygon Unity just restored. See
[MatchColliderToSprite](../inspector/utility-components.md#matchcollidertosprite) for exact-art
settings and programmatic use.

---

### PolygonCollider2DOptimizer Editor

An auto-generated `PolygonCollider2D` from a detailed sprite can carry hundreds of points, and Physics
2D pays for every one of them. This inspector shows a single **Tolerance** field and an **Optimize**
button that simplifies the outline in place.

Raise **Tolerance** until the silhouette starts to visibly change, then back off one step. `0.1`–`0.5`
is the usual working range; above `2.0` you are trading shape for point count. Set **Tolerance** to
`0` and click **Optimize** to restore the original outline — the component keeps it. **Optimize** is
also recorded as an `Optimize Polygon Collider` undo step.

See [PolygonCollider2DOptimizer](../inspector/utility-components.md#polygoncollider2doptimizer) for
the component.

---

### EnhancedImage Editor

`EnhancedImage` extends Unity's `Image` with an HDR tint and a shape mask, both of which need the
package's `BackgroundMask` material to do anything. The custom inspector is mostly there to notice
when that material is missing.

- If the component is still on Unity's **Default UI Material**, a yellow
  **Incorrect Material Detected - Try Fix?** button appears. Clicking it finds and assigns
  `Shaders/Materials/BackgroundMask-Material.mat` as a `Fix EnhancedImage Material` undo step.
- **HDR Color** multiplies the image; push intensity above `1.0` to make it bloom under
  post-processing.
- **Shape Mask** takes a `Texture2D`. It only does something if the assigned material's shader
  exposes a `_ShapeMask` texture property — the inspector says so in the tooltip rather than failing
  silently.

See [EnhancedImage](../inspector/visual-components.md#enhancedimage-ugui) for the component and its
runtime API.

<a id="property-drawers-attributes"></a>

## Property Drawers & Attributes

These are the inspector attributes the tools above lean on most. The
[Inspector documentation](../inspector/inspector-overview.md) covers the full set. Collection
inspectors release their cached button textures on script reload and editor exit; the next draw
rebuilds the styles as needed.

<a id="winlineeditor-property-drawer"></a>

### WInLineEditor Property Drawer

Tuning an ability means selecting the `AbilityConfig` asset, editing it, then selecting the character
again to see the result. `[WInLineEditor]` draws the referenced asset's own inspector underneath the
field so you never leave.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public sealed class AbilityConfig : ScriptableObject { }

public sealed class AbilityLoadout : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Inherits the project-wide default from Unity Helpers Settings.
    [WInLineEditor]
    public AbilityConfig primary;

    // Always open, no object picker, taller body.
    [WInLineEditor(WInLineEditorMode.AlwaysExpanded, inspectorHeight: 260f, drawObjectField: false)]
    public AbilityConfig secondary;

    // Collapsed by default, with the texture preview turned on.
    [WInLineEditor(WInLineEditorMode.FoldoutCollapsed, drawPreview: true, previewHeight: 96f)]
    public Texture2D icon;
}
```

| Mode               | Behaviour                                                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UseSettings`      | Default. Follows the Inline Editors setting in Project Settings. |
| `AlwaysExpanded`   | Inspector is always drawn.                                       |
| `FoldoutExpanded`  | Foldout, open on first draw.                                     |
| `FoldoutCollapsed` | Foldout, closed on first draw.                                   |

Constructor parameters, in positional order:
`mode`, `inspectorHeight` (default `200`, floored at `160`), `drawPreview` (`false`),
`previewHeight` (`64`, floored at `40`), `drawObjectField` (`true`), `drawHeader` (`true`),
`enableScrolling` (`true`), `minInspectorWidth` (`520`; below this width a horizontal scrollbar
appears, `0` disables that). Prefer named arguments — the order is easy to get wrong.

**Field-only.** Unlike the other attributes here, `[WInLineEditor]` targets fields, so on an
auto-property you need `[field: WInLineEditor]`.

It reuses Unity's own editor for the target, so custom inspectors, validation and undo all still
work. Foldout animation speed lives in
[Inspector Settings](../inspector/inspector-settings.md#inline-editor-settings).

### WShowIf Property Drawer

Half the fields on a spawner only matter when it is set to burst mode, and showing them the rest of
the time is how designers set the wrong one. `[WShowIf]` hides a field until its condition holds.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public sealed class EnemySpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public enum SpawnMode
    {
        Continuous = 1,
        Burst = 2,
    }

    public SpawnMode mode = SpawnMode.Continuous;

    [WShowIf(nameof(mode), expectedValues = new object[] { SpawnMode.Burst })]
    public int burstSize = 5;

    [WShowIf(nameof(mode), inverse: true, expectedValues: new object[] { SpawnMode.Burst })]
    public float spawnsPerSecond = 1f;

    public bool useSpawnBudget;

    [WShowIf(nameof(useSpawnBudget))]
    public int maxAlive = 20;

    [WShowIf(nameof(maxAlive), WShowIfComparison.GreaterThan, 50)]
    public bool warnAboutPerformance;

    public string overrideLayerName;

    [WShowIf(nameof(overrideLayerName), WShowIfComparison.IsNotNullOrEmpty)]
    public int sortingOrder;
}
```

`inverse` and `comparison` are **constructor arguments** (`inverse: true`), not object-initializer
assignments — `inverse = true` will not compile. `expectedValues` accepts either form.

| Comparison                          | Use for                                     |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Equal`, `NotEqual`                 | Any equatable value; the default is `Equal` |
| `GreaterThan`, `GreaterThanOrEqual` | Numbers and any `IComparable`               |
| `LessThan`, `LessThanOrEqual`       | Numbers and any `IComparable`               |
| `IsNull`, `IsNotNull`               | Object references                           |
| `IsNullOrEmpty`, `IsNotNullOrEmpty` | Strings and collections                     |

`WShowIfComparison.Unknown` exists only for backward compatibility and is marked obsolete.

The condition can be a field, a property (including a `[field: SerializeField]` auto-property), a
parameterless method, or a dotted path into a nested serialized type:

```csharp
[WShowIf(nameof(damage) + "." + nameof(DamageProfile.isCritical))]
public float criticalMultiplier;
```

> **Visual Reference**

> _Field appears/disappears based on enum toggle state_

---

### StringInList Property Drawer

A `string` field that has to match an animator state name or an asset label is a typo waiting to
happen. `[StringInList]` turns it into a dropdown of the values that are actually valid.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Helper;

public sealed class SpawnRule : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Fixed set.
    [StringInList("Idle", "Run", "Jump")]
    public string startState = "Idle";

    // Every asset label in the project, kept current by the Sprite Label Processor.
    [StringInList(typeof(Helpers), nameof(Helpers.GetAllSpriteLabelNames))]
    public List<string> requiredLabels = new();

    // A provider on this same type.
    [StringInList(nameof(GetPoolNames))]
    public string poolName;

    private IEnumerable<string> GetPoolNames()
    {
        yield return "Grunt";
        yield return "Archer";
        yield return "Brute";
    }
}
```

That second field is how the package itself populates the label pickers in
[Sprite Atlas Generator](#sprite-atlas-generator).

A provider method takes no parameters and returns `string[]` or `IEnumerable<string>`. It may be
`private`, and it may be static or an instance method. `[StringInList(typeof(T), "Method")]` looks for
a static method on `T` first, then an instance one; `[StringInList("Method")]` looks on the decorated
object's own type.

- On an `int` field the dropdown selects by index.
- On an array or list you get a UI Toolkit list with a dropdown per element, plus add, remove and
  drag-to-reorder.
- Typing filters the list. `Tab` accepts the highlighted match, `Enter` just fills the search box.
- Long lists paginate. The page size is
  **Project Settings ▸ Wallstop Studios ▸ Unity Helpers ▸ StringInList Page Size** (default `25`),
  shared with the `SerializableType` drawer.

---

### IntDropDown Property Drawer

For an `int` that only has a handful of legal values, a free text field lets someone type `3000` into
a texture size. `[IntDropDown]` restricts it to the list.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public sealed class AtlasSettings : MonoBehaviour
{
    [IntDropDown(32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384)]
    public int maxTextureSize = 2048;

    [IntDropDown(0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32)]
    public int padding = 4;
}
```

Those two fields are lifted from `ScriptableSpriteAtlas`, which is exactly how
[Sprite Atlas Generator](#sprite-atlas-generator) keeps its packing settings legal.

The attribute is spelled `IntDropDown` with a capital `D`. Like `StringInList` it also accepts a
provider: `[IntDropDown(typeof(T), nameof(T.Method))]` or `[IntDropDown(nameof(Method))]`, returning
`int[]` or `IEnumerable<int>`.

> **Visual Reference**
>
> ![IntDropDown showing texture size options](../../images/editor-tools/intdropdown-texturesize.gif)
>
> _IntDropDown for texture sizes showing power-of-two options_

---

### WValueDropDown Property Drawer

`StringInList` and `IntDropDown` for everything else — floats, bools, enums, Unity structs, and your
own serializable types.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public sealed class WeaponTuning : MonoBehaviour
{
    [WValueDropDown(0.5f, 1.0f, 1.5f, 2.0f)]
    public float damageMultiplier = 1.0f;

    [WValueDropDown("Easy", "Normal", "Hard", "Insane")]
    public string difficulty = "Normal";

    // Instance provider: the options depend on this component's own state.
    [WValueDropDown(nameof(GetMuzzleOffsets), typeof(Vector2))]
    public Vector2 muzzleOffset;

    public List<Vector2> configuredMuzzles = new();

    private IEnumerable<Vector2> GetMuzzleOffsets()
    {
        return configuredMuzzles;
    }
}
```

There is a `params` overload for every primitive (`bool`, `char`, all the integer widths, `float`,
`double`, `string`). For anything else, use a provider:

- `[WValueDropDown(typeof(Library), nameof(Library.GetPresets))]` — static provider, element type
  inferred from the return type.
- `[WValueDropDown(nameof(GetOptions), typeof(Vector2))]` — instance provider on the decorated type,
  value type stated.
- `[WValueDropDown(typeof(Preset), presetA, presetB)]` — an inline list of custom-typed values.

Providers follow the same rules as `StringInList`: parameterless, may be private, returning an array
or `IEnumerable`. Labels come from `ToString()`, so give a custom type a readable one.

Full constructor reference:

### WReadOnly Property Drawer

Shows a serialized value in the inspector without letting anyone edit it — useful for a number your
code derives and a designer should only ever read.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;

public sealed class Health : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int baseHealth = 100;
    public int equipmentBonus;

    [WReadOnly]
    public int totalHealth;

    private void OnValidate()
    {
        totalHealth = baseHealth + equipmentBonus;
    }
}
```

No parameters and nothing to configure. It works on any serialized type and keeps the field's normal
height and layout.

For attributes that _reject_ a bad value rather than just displaying it, see
[Inspector Validation Attributes](../inspector/inspector-validation-attributes.md).

## Automation & Utilities

### ScriptableObject Singleton Creator

Runs automatically on editor load. No menu item.

`ScriptableObjectSingleton<T>` loads its asset from `Resources`, which means a new teammate's first
run of the game fails on a settings asset nobody committed. This watches for singleton types with no
asset and creates them, and relocates any that end up in the wrong folder.

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Utils;

public sealed class GameSettings : ScriptableObjectSingleton<GameSettings>
{
    public float masterVolume = 1f;
    public bool enableVSync = true;
}

[ScriptableSingletonPath("Settings/Audio")]
public sealed class MusicSettings : ScriptableObjectSingleton<MusicSettings>
{
    public float musicVolume = 0.8f;
}
```

Write those two files, let the editor reload, and you have:

```text
Assets/
  Resources/
    GameSettings.asset                   # no [ScriptableSingletonPath]
    Settings/
      Audio/
        MusicSettings.asset              # [ScriptableSingletonPath("Settings/Audio")]
```

Then `GameSettings.Instance.masterVolume` works in play mode and in a build, with nothing to
remember.

Move `GameSettings.asset` somewhere else by hand and the next domain reload moves it back — the
attribute is the source of truth for where it lives.

See [Singleton Utilities](../utilities/singletons.md) for the runtime base class, its lookup order
and Odin compatibility.

### Sprite Label Processor

Runs automatically on sprite import. No menu item.

Asset labels are a good way to say "this sprite belongs in the UI atlas", but there is no cheap way
to ask Unity for every label in the project — you would have to load every asset. This
`AssetPostprocessor` maintains the list as sprites are imported, so a dropdown can be populated
instantly.

That is what makes this one line work:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Attributes;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Helper;

public sealed class AtlasRule : MonoBehaviour
{
    [StringInList(typeof(Helpers), nameof(Helpers.GetAllSpriteLabelNames))]
    public List<string> labels = new();
}
```

`Helpers.GetAllSpriteLabelNames()` returns the cached array; the
`GetAllSpriteLabelNames(List<string> destination)` overload fills a list you own instead of
allocating. [Sprite Atlas Generator](#sprite-atlas-generator) uses exactly this for its label
pickers.

**Editor-only.** The cache is built by an `AssetPostprocessor`, so both methods return empty in a
player build, in batch mode, and in CI. Do not build runtime behaviour on them.

Only `.png`, `.jpg` and `.jpeg` assets under `Assets` whose importer type is `Sprite` contribute
labels, and the result is sorted so a dropdown is stable between sessions.

<a id="request-script-recompilation"></a>

### Request Script Compilation

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Request Script Compilation` — `Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + R`

You generated a `.cs` file from outside Unity — a codegen step, a script pulled by a package tool —
and the editor has not noticed. Rather than touching a file to force a rebuild, press the shortcut.

It runs a forced synchronous `AssetDatabase.Refresh` (so the new file is imported first) and then
`CompilationPipeline.RequestScriptCompilation()`. If Unity is already compiling it logs
`Script compilation already in progress; manual request skipped.` and does nothing, so leaning on the
shortcut is harmless.

Rebind it under `Edit > Shortcuts` in **Wallstop Studios ▸ Request Script Compilation**.

### Project Settings: Unity Helpers

`Edit > Project Settings > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers`

One panel for the package's project-wide defaults: inspector pagination, inline editor behaviour,
button and toggle colours, and the coroutine wait buffers.

**Coroutine wait buffers.** `yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.25f)` allocates every time it runs.
The package pools those instructions, and this panel controls the pool: a quantization step (how
finely wait times are bucketed), a cap on distinct cached entries, and whether the cap evicts
least-recently-used. Settings are written to
`Assets/Resources/Wallstop Studios/Unity Helpers/UnityHelpersBufferSettings.asset` and applied on
domain reload and player start, so they ship with the build.

**Inspector pagination.** `StringInListPageSize` (default `25`) sets how many options a
[StringInList](#stringinlist-property-drawer) dropdown shows per page; `EnumToggleButtonsPageSize`
(default `15`) does the same for `[WEnumToggleButtons]` grids. Raise them if lists feel cramped,
lower them if a big enum makes the inspector sluggish. Individual fields can override both.

### Attribute Metadata Cache Generator

Runs automatically on editor load and after every recompile. No menu item.

The [Effects system](../effects/effects-system.md) and the
[relational component attributes](../relational-components/relational-components.md) resolve fields
by reflection. Doing that on the first frame is a visible stall, and on IL2CPP some of it cannot be
done at all. This walks your types at edit time and bakes the answers into an
`AttributeMetadataCache` asset that ships with the build.

The scan filters each discovered type once and avoids additional temporary query stages during
reloads.

You do not call the generator. It runs on load, and the `AttributeMetadataCache` asset's inspector
has a **Purge & Refresh Cache** button for when you want to force it.

Read the baked data if you are building tooling of your own:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles -->

```csharp
using System;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Tags;

public static class AttributeInspectorSupport
{
    public static void Dump(Type componentType)
    {
        AttributeMetadataCache cache = AttributeMetadataCache.Instance;

        // Every attribute name declared anywhere in the project.
        string[] all = cache.AllAttributeNames;

        if (cache.TryGetFieldNames(componentType, out string[] fieldNames))
        {
            Debug.Log($"{componentType.Name} declares {fieldNames.Length} of {all.Length} attributes.");
        }

        if (
            cache.TryGetRelationalFields(
                componentType,
                out AttributeMetadataCache.RelationalFieldMetadata[] relational
            )
        )
        {
            foreach (AttributeMetadataCache.RelationalFieldMetadata field in relational)
            {
                Debug.Log($"{field.fieldName} is a {field.attributeKind} field.");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

What gets baked: the attribute fields on every `AttributesComponent` type, the
`[ParentComponent]` / `[ChildComponent]` / `[SiblingComponent]` metadata, assembly-qualified type
names so they resolve at runtime, whether each field is a single value, array, `List` or `HashSet`,
and whether its element type is an interface.

---

### Editor Utilities

`WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Utils.EditorUtilities`

A wizard that creates an asset should create it where the user is looking, not in `Assets/`. Unity
does not expose the Project window's selected folder, so this does.

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Utils;

public static class CreateAbilityAsset
{
    [MenuItem("Assets/Create/Game/Ability Config")]
    private static void Create()
    {
        AbilityConfig asset = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<AbilityConfig>();

        string folder = EditorUtilities.GetCurrentPathOfProjectWindow();
        string directory = string.IsNullOrEmpty(folder) ? "Assets" : folder;

        AssetDatabase.CreateAsset(
            asset,
            AssetDatabase.GenerateUniqueAssetPath($"{directory}/NewAbilityConfig.asset")
        );
        AssetDatabase.SaveAssets();
        Selection.activeObject = asset;
    }
}
```

`GetCurrentPathOfProjectWindow()` returns an asset-relative path such as `Assets/Data/Abilities`, or
an empty string when it cannot determine one — always have a fallback, as above. It reaches an
internal Unity API by reflection, so treat the empty-string case as normal rather than exceptional.

`IsInvokedByTestRunner()` reports whether this editor process was launched with Unity Test Runner
command-line arguments, by looking for `runTests`, `testResults` or `testPlatform` in the command
line. A run started from the in-editor Test Runner window does not carry those arguments and is not
detected — this answers "was this editor launched to run tests", not "is a test session running
right now". A window's `OnEnable` runs during a command-line test session too, so work that
consumes fixtures or writes logs should be gated on it — together with `Application.isBatchMode`
and [`Helpers.IsRunningInContinuousIntegration`](../utilities/helper-utilities.md#cicd-detection),
the other two legs of the same question:

<!-- doc-sample: compiles-editor -->

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Core.Helper;
using WallstopStudios.UnityHelpers.Editor.Utils;

public sealed class AssetReportWindow : EditorWindow
{
    private void OnEnable()
    {
        if (
            Application.isBatchMode
            || EditorUtilities.IsInvokedByTestRunner()
            || Helpers.IsRunningInContinuousIntegration
        )
        {
            return;
        }

        ImportReports();
    }

    private void ImportReports() { /* fixture-consuming work */ }
}
```

It answers `false` rather than throwing, even on a host that refuses to share its command line. If
all you want is to skip dialogs, `EditorUi` already folds this in behind
`EditorUi.Confirm`/`EditorUi.Info`; reach for this predicate when the work itself, not just the
prompt, should be skipped.

`IndentLevelScope.Indent()` and `IndentLevelScope.AtLevel(level)` change
`EditorGUI.indentLevel` without per-scope garbage after the shared owner has warmed to the maximum
concurrent nesting depth. Copies are safe to dispose more than once. Nested scopes also restore the
newest still-active level when copies are disposed out of order, rather than replaying a stale
global value over an inner drawer.

### Failed Tests Exporter

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Export Failed Tests` / `Clear Failed Tests`

A flaky test that fails once in twenty runs is invisible if the only record is the Test Runner window
you already closed. Enable this in
`Edit > Project Settings > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers` and every failure — name, message, stack
trace — is captured and written to `failed-tests-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss.txt` in a folder you choose
(project root by default).

Disabled by default. Both menu items are greyed out until there are failures to act on.

Full setup and API: [Failed Tests Exporter](./failed-tests-exporter.md).

---

<a id="test-run-reporter"></a>

### Test Run Reporter

`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Run EditMode Tests With Summary` /
`Run PlayMode Tests With Summary`

Starts a test run and returns immediately, having first opened
`<project>/Temp/unity-helpers-test-run-<mode>.txt` with a `running` marker. When the run ends the
file is rewritten with one summary line, one line per assembly, and one line per failure carrying
its message and source location. A process driving an editor it does not own polls that file instead
of scraping the console, which can be cleared out from under it.

EditMode and PlayMode write different files, a second run is refused while one is in flight, and the
callbacks are re-registered after the domain reload a PlayMode run causes.

Format, poller example and recovery from a lost run: [Test Run Reporter](./test-run-reporter.md).

---

### MultiFile Selector

`MultiFileSelectorElement` is the UI Toolkit control the tools above use for "pick several files or
folders". It is public, so your own editor windows can use it too.

In the editor it remembers selections through `EditorPrefs` and offers Reveal in Finder / Show in
Explorer. In a player build it falls back to `PlayerPrefs` and enumerates files under the
application's data root, dropping the editor-only affordances.

Persistence is opt-in per element, via a `persistenceKey`. Stored scopes are managed from
`Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Multi-File Selector Persistence`, which can
**Run Cleanup Now** or drop scopes unused for more than **Max age (days)** (default `30`) on editor
startup.

There is a runnable example in the `UI Toolkit - MultiFile Selector (Editor)` sample, importable from
the Package Manager.

[Asset Change Detection](./asset-change-detection.md).

Shared across the windows: folder fields accept dragged Project-window folders, the folders you pick
are remembered per tool and offered again next time, and long operations report progress in the
console rather than blocking silently.

Progress bars close even when an operation, asset save, or batch cleanup fails. This includes
prefab checks, sprite atlas generation and source settings, sprite and texture settings, texture
resizing, sprite reference replacement, and animation copy or delete operations. Canceling a prefab
scan keeps findings already collected; canceling a settings batch saves the importer changes already
processed. A processing error still stops the operation and may leave earlier changes applied.
Reimport and generated-file side effects are not a transaction and cannot be fully reversed with Undo.

### What writes to disk

Most of these tools only change import settings, which Unity records as an undo step and which you
can revert by reverting the `.meta` file. These are the ones that write real files:

| Tool                                              | Effect                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Image Blur Tool](#image-blur-tool)               | Writes new files; restores temporary source import-setting changes             |
| [Sprite Cropper](#sprite-cropper)                 | Writes PNGs; overwrites sources when **Overwrite Originals** is on             |
| [Texture Resizer](#texture-resizer)               | Overwrites source PNGs unless **Output Folder** is set                         |
| [Sprite Sheet Extractor](#sprite-sheet-extractor) | Writes new PNGs; the Danger Zone rewrites referencing assets                   |
| [Sprite Cropper](#sprite-cropper) Danger Zone     | Rewrites `.prefab`, `.unity`, `.asset`, `.mat`, `.anim`, `.overrideController` |
| [Animation Copier](#animation-copier)             | Copies and (in Cleanup) deletes `.anim` assets                                 |
| [Prefab Checker](#prefab-checker)                 | Read-only unless you enable auto-fix and click **Fix Missing Scripts**         |

Everything else — [Texture Settings Applier](#texture-settings-applier),
[Sprite Settings Applier](#sprite-settings-applier),
[Sprite Pivot Adjuster](#sprite-pivot-adjuster), [Fit Texture Size](#fit-texture-size) — touches
import settings only and records a named undo step.

None of the tools that rewrite image data have an undo. Commit before running them.

### Common workflows

**A folder of new character art:**

1. [Sprite Sheet Extractor](#sprite-sheet-extractor) if it arrived as sheets.
2. [Sprite Cropper](#sprite-cropper) to trim the padding.
3. [Sprite Settings Applier](#sprite-settings-applier) for PPU and filter mode.
4. [Sprite Pivot Adjuster](#sprite-pivot-adjuster) so the pivots agree.
5. [Animation Creator](#animation-creator) to build the clips.
6. [Animation Event Editor](#animation-event-editor) for footsteps and hitboxes.
7. [Sprite Atlas Generator](#sprite-atlas-generator) to pack them.

**Before you open a pull request:**

1. [Prefab Checker](#prefab-checker) over the prefab folders you touched.
2. [Unity Method Analyzer](#unity-method-analyzer) over `Assets/Scripts`.
3. [Serialized Field Validator](#serialized-field-validator) on any new `MonoBehaviour` or
   `ScriptableObject`.

**Trimming build size:**

1. [Fit Texture Size](#fit-texture-size) in `GrowAndShrink` mode across `Assets/Sprites`.
2. [Sprite Cropper](#sprite-cropper) on anything still padded.
3. [Texture Settings Applier](#texture-settings-applier) with crunch compression and per-platform max
   sizes.

### When something does not work

| Symptom                                    | Likely cause                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A sprite tool skips files silently         | It is a multi-sprite texture, or `Read/Write Enabled` is off. Cropper and Pivot Adjuster need Single sprites.                 |
| **Scan Folders** finds nothing             | The regex does not match, or the folder path is outside `Assets/`. Invalid regexes are logged and match nothing.              |
| An atlas looks worse than the source       | Run **Force Uncompressed for N Source Sprites** before packing.                                                               |
| Clips landed in the wrong folder           | [Animation Creator](#animation-creator) writes beside the first sprite. Move them with [Animation Copier](#animation-copier). |
| An `[AnimationEvent]` method is not listed | It must return `void` and take zero or one `int` / `float` / `string` / `UnityEngine.Object` / enum parameter.                |
| Prefab Checker reports nothing             | The relevant checks may be off — **Empty String Fields** and **Disabled Components** are off by default.                      |
| **Fix Missing Scripts** is greyed out      | Tick **Enable Auto-fix options** first.                                                                                       |
| A tool did nothing in a CI or batch run    | Dialogs and folder pickers are suppressed in batch mode, so anything that needs one is skipped.                               |
