# Session 186 — attributing, and removing, WallstopProto's read allocation

Branch: `dev/wallstop/session-186-read-allocation`. Baseline: `main` at `5676639f`, package `3.5.1`.

## Why this was next

The exhaustive GitHub audit found 35 open issues, no open or draft pull request, and no prior-session
branch left unfinished; `main` was green at `5676639f` with its post-merge matrix still running. #343
remains the highest gameplay-impacting item, and the open piece of it that a game feels every frame
is #398: the write path reuses a caller's buffer and allocates nothing, while the read path allocated
**5,272 B/op against protobuf-net's 4,112** for the same object graph. Garbage on a per-frame or
per-save read is a frame-time spike, not a micro-optimization.

The issue's own instruction was to measure before pooling anything. Session 184 had already built
the aggregate benchmark it asked for, so the open work started one step later.

## The aggregate could not say what to fix

The 1,160 B gap was one number over five member shapes. The first change was therefore an
instrument, not an optimization: one contract per member shape, each measured against protobuf-net
decoding the **identical** graph, so the difference is the serializer's overhead rather than the
payload's. It attributed the whole gap to two shapes and exonerated three:

| Shape                       | Before      | After   | protobuf-net |
| --------------------------- | ----------: | ------: | -----------: |
| `int[128]`                  | 1,744 B/op  | **560** |          560 |
| `List<int>[128]`            | 1,208 B/op  | **592** |          624 |
| `string`                    | 88 B/op     | 88      |           88 |
| `Dictionary<string,int>[32]`| 3,384 B/op  | 3,384   |        3,384 |
| nested contract             | 96 B/op     | 96      |           96 |

The string, map and nested paths already matched the oracle byte for byte. Every byte of the gap was
the repeated path.

## The cause was the accumulator, and the count was already on the wire

An array member decoded into a `List<T>` that doubled from empty and was then copied out of, so 128
`int`s left six abandoned buffers plus a duplicate of the answer. A packed run carries the element
count already: `WProtoReader.CountPackedElements` reads it off the encoded bytes without consuming
them — **exactly**, because a varint element ends at the byte whose continuation bit is clear, and a
fixed-width run divides — and the generator spends it:

- arrays accumulate into `WProtoArrayBuilder<T>`, a struct that reserves once and **hands its buffer
  over** when it comes out exactly full, so there is no growth and no copy;
- every `List<T>`-backed accumulator (a `List<T>` member, an interface-typed member,
  `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`, `Stack<T>`, and a deferred read's pending list) is sized through
  `WProtoRepeated.Reserve`;
- `HashSet<T>`, `Queue<T>`, `LinkedList<T>` and consumer collections are left alone: no capacity API
  they all have on every Unity version this package supports.

The result is `5,272 -> 4,088 B/op` aggregate, **below the oracle's 4,112**, with throughput
unchanged (2,153-2,237 ns/op across three runs against a 2,213 ns/op baseline). Nothing about the
wire format moved, so no golden vector changed.

**An unpacked run gets none of this and should not.** It is a sequence of separate fields that may be
interleaved with other members, so its length is unknowable until it ends. That is what protobuf-net
writes, and reading it still grows exactly as before.

## The bar is the oracle, not a constant

Both gates — the aggregate and the per-shape one — assert against protobuf-net's own allocation for
the same contract rather than a hand-written ceiling. Two implementations returning the same graph
must allocate the same, so anything above it is overhead this package chose; and no number needs
re-tuning when a runtime changes what a `Dictionary` costs. The previous fixed ceiling of `5,272`
carried a comment asking for exactly this when the allocations came down.

## Verification

- Generator suite, protobuf-net **3.2.56**: 318/318, three consecutive runs.
- Generator suite, protobuf-net **2.4.9**: 317/317. The v2 oracle allocates far more on every shape
  (1,800 B/op for `int[128]`), which is why the comparison is pinned per oracle rather than shared.
- `npm run typecheck:unity`: all four legs (runtime default and legacy, tests default and legacy),
  zero warnings.
- Real Unity **6000.4.6f1** editor over the MCP bridge: **39 of 39 package assemblies fresh**, empty
  console, and **210 of 210** WProto fixtures passing in PlayMode — the new read-sizing fixture plus
  every collection, map, include, surrogate, marshal, generic, facade and wire-format fixture.
- The editor also caught a defect the desktop suite could not: `AVarintRunCountsItsElementsExactly`
  wrote 1,000 mixed-sign `int`s into a fixed 4 KB scratch buffer, and a negative `int32` varint is
  ten bytes. Only the 1000-element case failed. The scratch is sized from the widest encoding now.
- No Unity license is configured in this devcontainer (`setup-license.ps1 -Check` reports it), so the
  Docker EditMode/PlayMode legs are CI's; the MCP editor is the local substitute.

## Mutations

Three, all caught, and the second is the one worth keeping.

1. **Emit no reservation at all** — the state this session started in. The per-shape gate reports
   1,744 B/op against the oracle's 560. Caught by construction, which is what makes the gate a
   red-green one rather than a description.
2. **Hand over the buffer even when it is not exactly full** (`_count <= _items.Length` in
   `ToArray`): 17 of 318 generator tests fail. Correctness, not allocation — the trailing default
   elements show up wherever the reserved count and the final size differ (a seeded array, an
   interleaved run).
3. **Over-count the packed run** (`return remaining` for varints): **every correctness test still
   passes**, and only the allocation gates fail — 1,576 B/op per array and 5,104 aggregate against
   the oracle's 4,112. An inexact count is a silent performance regression with no behavioral
   symptom, which is exactly the class of defect a measured gate exists to catch.

The shipped analyzer was confirmed byte-identical to a fresh Release build afterwards, on the same
SDK CI pins (9.0.306), so the restore left nothing behind.

## Folded-in CI work

**#428 — the Copilot reviewer's quota failure is not a repository failure.** It fails with HTTP 402
before reading any code, twice on #427, and every push re-requests it and reproduces the same red.
No repository change can clear it. The supported policy (the issue's option 3) is now written where a
landing session actually reads it — [ship-changes Step 10](../.llm/skills/ship-changes.md) — with the
signature to recognize it by (no analysis produced, sub-minute duration, HTTP 402) and the rule that
repository-owned checks are what "all green" means. Restoring the quota or dropping the reviewer from
the required set stays an owner action in organization settings.

## The review question that found a shipped defect

The owner asked on the pull request whether a wire-stated size could be trusted -- "if someone sent a
malicious payload that says there are 1 billion elements... here and anywhere else?"

For this change the answer is no: `CountPackedElements` counts bytes that are present, and
`TryReadLength` already refuses a length prefix longer than the buffer, so a billion elements costs a
billion bytes and the worst amplification is the element width (8x for 1-byte varints into `long`).
It is strictly better than the growth-doubling it replaced.

**The sweep it prompted found the real thing, and it is shipped.** A *capacity* is not a length: it
has nothing behind it. Six bytes -- field 2 of the collection wrappers, holding `int.MaxValue`, no
elements -- reached `new T[2147483647]`:

| Site | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Deque`'s `[ProtoAfterDeserialization]` hook | 8 GB, on any consumer using protobuf-net directly |
| Both deque readers (wrapper and marshal) | 8 GB |
| Both sparse-set readers | 16 GB, two index arrays |
| `BitSet` / `ImmutableBitSet` JSON | a claimed capacity, or one huge index, buys hundreds of MB |

`CyclicBuffer` was the only one safe, and by accident: it keeps its capacity as a number and
allocates its `List<T>` lazily.

The remedy is one rule with two verbs, because the consequence of ignoring a claim differs. Where the
capacity is a growth hint the structure re-derives, `SerializationCapacityLimits.Clamp` keeps every
delivered element and starts smaller. Where it is semantic -- a sparse set's universe decides what it
accepts later -- `TryAccept` refuses, because clamping would change behavior rather than allocation.
The delivered count is always the floor, and the ceiling is a knob the game sets for its own data.

Verified in the editor with the attacker's own six bytes: 16 cases confirmed by name, and 410 across
the surrounding `Deque`, `SparseSet`, `BitSet` and marshal suites, all green. The rule is recorded as
[untrusted-payload-limits](../.llm/skills/untrusted-payload-limits.md) and as critical rule 17, so it
is applied by construction rather than remembered.

### The review round on the fix itself

Cursor caught a real defect in the new check, and it is the kind worth recording: the capacity an
index implies is `index + 1`, so an index of `int.MaxValue` wrapped to `int.MinValue`, left
`required` at zero, and waved the document straight past the refusal into `TrySet` -- which threw.
The payload was still rejected, so a test asserting only "it threw" would have passed while the guard
did nothing. The arithmetic is `long` now, and the regression test asserts **which** failure happened
by matching the refusal text through the exception chain, because the facade wraps a converter's
exception in its own.

Confirmed in the editor: 18 of 18, including `int.MaxValue`, 2,000,000,000, and a negative index
(ignored rather than counted, since a negative index cannot be set at all).

### The one red that was neither ours nor a regression

CI then failed the benchmark's **throughput** assertion on the hosted runner:

```text
WallstopProto serialize: 0.00 B/op, 17,710.78 ns/op   (800 ns/op locally)
protobuf-net serialize:  40.00 B/op,  7,314.44 ns/op
```

Allocation was identical to a green run, and deserialize was still 1.8x faster. A 22x stall on one
round is the machine, not the code -- and it also explains the single unattributed failure seen
locally earlier in this session, which had looked like a rare flake with no cause.

**The estimator was the defect.** A median of five rounds does not survive one descheduled round, and
this assertion had been comparing medians. It compares the **fastest** round on each side now: noise
only ever adds time, so the minimum is the closest either implementation gets to its own cost, and a
real regression -- which is present in every round -- still fails. Measured after the change, on a
machine deliberately kept busy: medians of 4,725 against 8,269 ns/op, minima of 1,700 against 2,538,
where the minima are the stable pair.

### The hot-path round, and a claim withdrawn

Review asked whether `Array.Resize` was the official spelling for the builder's grow, and for a pass
over the new hot path. Three answers, each measured:

- **`Array.Resize` is idiomatic, not faster.** With the allocation held outside the loop the copy
  primitives are the same memmove -- `Array.Copy` 2.85 ns/op against `Span.CopyTo` 2.60 at 64
  elements, 80.12 against 79.55 at 4096. The first attempt timed the whole grow including two
  allocations and reported `Array.Resize` 1.25x faster at 64 and 1.76x *slower* at 4096; a
  contradiction that size is allocator noise, not a result. With the primitive a wash the deciding
  factor is how much each copies, and `Array.Resize` takes the whole old buffer where this takes the
  live prefix. Kept, with the reasoning in the file.
- **`List.CopyTo` for the pending list: 11.06 ns/op against 76.33** on 256 elements. One memmove
  against a bounds-checked read and write per element. Shipped.
- **A slice of the packed-run scan was measured, believed, and then withdrawn.** Slicing into a
  zero-based local looked 1.39x faster -- but that comparison called through a freshly constructed
  reader on one side and an inlined loop on the other, so it was timing the construction. Held fair,
  the slice is **302.97 ns/op against 285.88**: slower. The loop is unchanged and the file records
  the failed experiment.

The lesson is the same one the benchmark estimator taught an hour earlier, from the other direction:
**a measurement that does not hold everything else constant measures the thing you forgot.** One
produced a false red on green code; the other nearly produced a false claim in a code comment.

## What #398 has left, and why it is not this session's work

The string interner and "merge into the caller's existing collection" both change what a read hands
back rather than how it accumulates, and the measurement does not indict either: `string` and the map
path already allocate exactly what protobuf-net does. Reopen them with a shape that measures worse,
not on the reasoning in the issue.

## Session limitation to hand back

The branch pushes cleanly over the `pr` SSH remote, which needs no credential broker. Everything
that needs the **GitHub API** — opening the pull request, filing follow-up issues — does not work
from a headless session: no token exists inside the container, `origin`'s HTTPS remote goes through
the VS Code credential helper, and that helper answers by prompting on the host. So the pull request
itself is opened from the VS Code GitHub extension, against
`dev/wallstop/session-186-read-allocation`. Nothing else in the session depended on it, and only the
push-triggered `Spelling Check` (green) runs until the pull request exists — the Unity matrix is
`pull_request`-triggered.
