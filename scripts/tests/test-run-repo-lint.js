  //     cannot go red.

  //     script names in a string literal it is asserting the CONTENTS of. That helper answers
  //     "does anything run this", which is the assertion above, not this one.
  //   * a comment-stripped basename token, to exclude a linter named only in prose -- measured to
  //     select exactly the same seven, so it is complexity with no present effect.
