# Removes the two things Dev Containers leaves behind in ~/.gitconfig that break this container.
#
# Both come from one behaviour: Dev Containers copies the HOST's ~/.gitconfig into the container at
# attach time. It writes its credential helper into whichever git config it is managing, and
# post-create.sh has already created ~/.gitconfig (`git config --global --add safe.directory`), so
# the helper lands there as well as in the /etc/gitconfig copy written at container start.
#
#   1. A DUPLICATE credential.helper. Git runs EVERY configured helper on EVERY credential request,
#      so two identical registrations mean two host dialogs per operation and two `password=`
#      records in one response. A caller that reads the response with `sed -n 's/^password=//p'`
#      gets two concatenated tokens and builds a malformed Authorization header from them -- which
#      still authenticates GETs and silently breaks request bodies on POST.
#
#   2. The host's WINDOWS safe.directory entries (`D:\`, `E:/Ambiguous Legal`). Git rejects each one
#      as "not absolute" and prints a warning per entry on EVERY git invocation, so every command in
#      the container carries six lines of noise that hide real output.
#
# Idempotent, and safe to run when neither problem is present. It never removes the LAST credential
# helper: /etc/gitconfig's copy is the one Dev Containers manages, and dropping both would break
# authentication entirely.
