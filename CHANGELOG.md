## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add `AnimationClip.GetSpriteFramesFromClip()`, which pairs every sprite a clip references with the binding that supplies it, a `GetSpritesFromClip(path, propertyName, type)` overload that filters on that binding, and `UnityExtensions.SpriteBindingProperty`. Editor-only. See [Sprites from an AnimationClip](./docs/features/utilities/math-and-extensions.md#sprites-from-an-animationclip) ([#451](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/451)).
- Add `AssetChangeDetectionUtility.Enabled`, `ResetEnabledToDefault()` and `EnabledScope(bool)` to turn the `[DetectAssetChanged]` watcher on and off. The returned `AssetChangeDetectionEnabledScope` restores the previous setting on dispose ([#327](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/327)).
- Add `SingleThreadedThreadPool.DrainAsync()`, which closes the pool and waits for queued work to finish instead of dropping it, plus `IsAcceptingWork` ([#318](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/318)).
- Add `SerializableList<T>`, a list that survives Unity serialization inside another serialized collection ([#314](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/314)).
- Add `Enum.TryConvertToUInt64()` and `TryConvertToInt64()`, which convert any enum value to its 64-bit bit pattern without overflowing on negative or very large members.
- Add `SemaphoreSlim.Acquire()`, `TryAcquire()` and `AcquireAsync()`, so a permit can be taken with `using` instead of a `finally`. See [Semaphore Leases](./docs/features/utilities/helper-utilities.md#semaphore-leases).
- Add `DurableFile`, whose writes cannot leave a truncated file behind: `TryWriteAllText`, `TryAppendAllText`, `TryCopy`, `TryDelete` and async equivalents. See [Durable Writes for Player Data](./docs/features/utilities/helper-utilities.md#durable-writes-for-player-data) ([#319](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/319)).
- Add `WallstopProto` (preview), a reflection-free protobuf reader and writer that AOT-compiles under IL2CPP and is byte-compatible with protobuf-net. See [WallstopProto](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#wallstopproto-the-reflection-free-wire-layer-preview) ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).
- Add the WallstopProto source generator (preview): annotate a type with `[WProtoContract]` and its formatter is generated into your assembly and registered for you. A contract it cannot serialize is a build error naming the fix. See [The generator](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#the-generator) ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).
- Add `WProtoFormatterProvider`, which resolves a type's `IWProtoFormatter<T>` without reflection and names the type when nothing is registered. Formatters ship for `FastVector2Int`, `FastVector3Int`, `WGuid` and `RandomState` ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).
- Add support for a `[WProtoMember]` that is another `[WProtoContract]`, including the same type again, so a tree or linked list serializes without a hand-written formatter. See [Contracts that hold other contracts](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#contracts-that-hold-other-contracts) ([#380](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/380)).
- Add WallstopProto support for arrays and any `ICollection<T>` with a public parameterless constructor and `Add`, including `struct` collections, which are not boxed on the write path. `OverwriteList = true` replaces the constructor's collection instead of appending. See [Collections](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#collections) ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).
- Add WallstopProto support for `LinkedList<T>`, `Queue<T>`, `Stack<T>`, `ReadOnlyCollection<T>`, `ReadOnlyDictionary<K,V>` and members declared as the matching interfaces. A `Stack<T>` round-trips in its original order. See [Collections](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#collections) ([#395](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/395)).
- Add WallstopProto support for nested and jagged collections — `int[][]`, `List<List<int>>`, `Dictionary<string, List<int>>` and deeper — which protobuf-net refuses. See [Collections](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#collections) ([#399](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/399)).
- Add WallstopProto support for rectangular arrays — `int[,]`, `int[,,]`, and one anywhere a collection can go — which protobuf-net refuses. Dimensions travel with the elements, so `new int[0, 5]` keeps its shape. See [Collections](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#collections) ([#434](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/434)).
- Add WallstopProto maps: a `Dictionary<,>`, `SortedDictionary<,>` or your own `IDictionary<,>` is written as a protobuf map, byte-compatible with protobuf-net. See [Maps](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#maps) ([#387](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/387)).
- Add WallstopProto polymorphism: `[WProtoInclude(tag, typeof(Subtype))]` round-trips a member typed as a base as its concrete subtype, with no reflection. An unrecognized include tag is skipped, so saves from newer builds still load. See [Polymorphism](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#polymorphism) ([#390](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/390)).
- Add `[assembly: WProtoSurrogate(typeof(Real), typeof(Surrogate))]`, which gives a wire shape to a type you cannot annotate — Unity's `Vector3`, `Color`, `Bounds` and the rest. See [Surrogates](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#surrogates) ([#391](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/391)).
- Add `[assembly: WProtoRootMarshal(typeof(Real), typeof(Formatter))]`, which gives a type a different wire shape as the root of a serialization than as a member of a contract. See [Root marshals](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#root-marshals-the-collections-with-two-encodings) ([#402](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/402)).
- Add `[assembly: WProtoDeclaredRoot(typeof(IRandom), typeof(AbstractRandom))]`, which names the contract serving a value held as an interface. It applies at the root only. See [Declared roots](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#declared-roots-serving-an-interface) ([#403](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/403)).
- Add generic `[WProtoContract]` support: each closed construction gets its own encoding and is registered automatically, so your own `Box<YourStruct>` needs no manual registration. See [Generic contracts](./docs/features/serialization/serialization.md#generic-contracts) ([#385](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/385)).
- Add WallstopProto support for `readonly` fields and get-only properties, previously a build error. The generator emits a private constructor into your `partial` type, so the type gains no public surface ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Add `WProtoContractAttribute.SkipConstructor`, which reads a contract without running any constructor its author wrote, matching protobuf-net's flag of the same name and still working under IL2CPP ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Add `WProtoContractAttribute.IgnoreListHandling`, which writes a contract that also implements `ICollection<T>` as a message. Without it such a member is a build error naming both readings ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).
- Add `IWProtoScalarFormatter<T>` and `WProtoGeneric<T>`, which make a value's wire type expressible so a generic contract can encode a member whose type it cannot see. `IWProtoFormatter<T>` is unchanged.
- Add `IWProtoPolymorphicFormatter`, which lets a formatter report the runtime types its `[WProtoInclude]` chain writes, so `Serializer` can serve a value held as its base ([#403](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/403)).
- Add `IWProtoConditionalFormatter`, so a formatter reports whether it can encode a closure before anything is written. An element WallstopProto cannot encode now falls back to protobuf-net instead of throwing mid-serialization ([#402](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/402), [#416](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/416)).
- Add `WProtoFacade.TryDeserializeAs()`, the read that names a concrete type. `Serializer.ProtoDeserialize<T>(byte[], Type)` routes through it ([#403](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/403)).
- Add `SerializationCapacityLimits`, the bound a deserializer applies to a capacity a payload claims, with `MaximumRestoredCapacity` for games whose saves are legitimately larger.
- Add `WProtoReader.CountPackedElements()`, `WProtoArrayBuilder<T>` and `WProtoRepeated.Reserve()`, so a hand-written formatter can size a repeated field once instead of growing it ([#398](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/398)).
- Add `WProtoReader.TryReadPackedRun()`, which reads a packed repeated field's payload as its own reader without spending a nesting level.
- Add `WProtoGeneric<T>.CanEncode`, which reports whether a closed type argument can be encoded at all.
- Add `WProtoRectangular`, the shape check and refusal message a hand-written rectangular-array formatter needs.
- Add `WProtoRepeated.NullElement()` and `NullNestedElement()`, which build the exceptions a generated formatter throws for a `null` repeated element or inner collection.
- Add `WProtoFormatterProvider.UnexpectedSubtype()`, which builds the exception thrown for a value whose runtime type its contract does not declare.
- Add `WPROTO028`, a warning when a closed construction cannot be registered because it closes over a `private` nested type. It is skipped rather than failing the build ([#414](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/414)).
- Add `WPROTO030`, an informational diagnostic when a `[ProtoContract]` has no `[WProtoContract]`, so migration is an opt-in worklist ([#407](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/407)).
- Add `WPROTO031`, a warning when assemblies declare different roots for the same type ([#419](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/419)).
- Add `WPROTO032`, a build error when a member's collections nest more than 64 deep, which is deeper than the reader can read back ([#399](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/399)).

### Security

- Clamp or refuse a capacity a payload claims in `Deque`, `SparseSet`, `BitSet` and `ImmutableBitSet`. Six bytes claiming `int.MaxValue` previously allocated 8-16 GB and crashed the player. Raise `SerializationCapacityLimits.MaximumRestoredCapacity` if your saves exceed 1,048,576 elements ([#429](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/pull/429)).

### Changed

- Enable WallstopProto by default for the runtime assembly: `Serializer.ProtoSerialize` and `ProtoDeserialize` use generated formatters when available and fall back to protobuf-net ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).
- Serialize thirty of this package's own contracts through WallstopProto when `WALLSTOP_PROTO` is defined, including `AbstractRandom` and all seventeen generators. Saved data is unchanged ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Serialize `SerializableHashSet`, `SerializableSortedSet`, `SerializableDictionary`, `SerializableSortedDictionary`, `Deque`, `CyclicBuffer` and `SparseSet` through WallstopProto when `WALLSTOP_PROTO` is defined. Saved data is unchanged ([#402](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/402)).
- Bound a rectangular array's dimensions individually: an empty one whose axis exceeds `SerializationCapacityLimits.MaximumRestoredCapacity` (default 1,048,576) no longer deserializes — raise that limit if you persist one. Arrays that carry elements are unaffected, at any limit ([#437](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/437)).
- Size a repeated member from the element count already in the packed run, so reading 128 `int`s into an array allocates 560 bytes instead of 1,744. Throughput is unchanged ([#398](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/398)).
- Allow a `struct` backing set in `SerializableSetBase<T, TSet>`: the `where TSet : class` constraint is gone ([#388](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/388)).
- Ship the bundled `System.Text.Json` and friends only on editors that do not provide them; Unity supplies its own from 6000.5. See [Bundled Assembly Conflicts](./docs/guides/bundled-assembly-conflicts.md) ([#331](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/331)).
- Fail the build (`WPROTO018`) when a `[WProtoContract]`'s base is one too but is not declared with `[WProtoInclude]`. It previously failed only when something serialized it ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Bound `WProtoReader` message nesting at `MaxNestingDepth` (64). A few kilobytes of hostile payload could otherwise describe thousands of nested sub-messages, which a formatter turns into thousands of stack frames ([#343](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/343)).

### Fixed

- Fix an unattributed field joining the wrong group when a type declares more than one `[WGroup]`, and a bare `[WGroupEnd]` closing a group other than the one it follows. Auto-include now targets the most recently declared group, and a bare end closes every open group ([#455](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/455)).
- Fix a `SerializableDictionary`'s "Add entry" Value field being drawn 8.5px left of its Key field wherever the inspector indents it ([#284](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/284)).
- Fix a watcher on a non-`GameObject` type loading every imported prefab, which is where `SendMessage cannot be called during Awake, CheckConsistency, or OnValidate` came from. A sub-asset nested inside a `.prefab` no longer matches a watcher on its type ([#280](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/280)).
- Fix the asset-change watcher deserializing assets during import to decide whether a path holds a watched type, which produced the same warning. The decision is now made from asset metadata ([#439](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/439)).
- Fix `[DetectAssetChanged]` crashing headless editors; it no longer initializes in batch mode ([#327](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/327)).
- Fix `SerializableDictionary<TKey, List<TValue>>` and its sorted counterpart saving their keys and none of their values. Dictionaries with other value types keep exactly the same saved data ([#314](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/314), [#348](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/348)).
- Report `SerializableHashSet<List<TValue>>` in the Inspector instead of drawing a column that persists nothing: a list compares by reference, so such a set already treats equal contents as distinct elements ([#314](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/314), [#354](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/354)).
- Fix the Inspector drawing an empty value column instead of an error for dictionary values no wrapper repairs, such as `List<List<T>>` and jagged arrays. Sorted dictionaries are covered too ([#357](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/357)).
- Add the missing Inspector drawer for `SerializableDictionary<TKey, TValue, TValueCache>` ([#314](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/314)).
- Fix `StartFunctionAsCoroutine()` and `ExecuteOverTime()` stopping forever the first time their action threw. Both now report the failure against the owning object and keep running ([#359](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/359)).
- Fix disabled logging still evaluating its receiver and building its message, so `MySingleton.Instance.Log($"…")` created the singleton and allocated in a release build. Define `ENABLE_UBERLOGGING` to keep logging — see [Logging Extensions](./docs/features/logging/logging-extensions.md) ([#350](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/350)).
- Fix `GetRandomPointInCircle()` and `GetRandomPointInSphere()` returning points outside the shape far from the origin: at world coordinate 1,000,000 with radius 0.05, half of them were outside.
- Fix `NativePcgRandom` producing worse randomness than every other generator: `NextFloat()` could return exactly 1, `NextLong()` could return a negative, `NextUint(0)` threw, and most seeds built a shortened-period stream. Sequences for a given seed have changed ([#282](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/282)).
- Fix `ToCachedName()` and `ToDisplayName()` falling back to a dictionary for any signed enum with a negative member, and `sbyte` enums allocating a 256-entry cache ([#339](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/339)).
- Fix `EditorCacheHelper.GetEnumDisplayName()` rebuilding the enum's value array on every call. Display names are unchanged.
- Fix `[WEnumToggleButtons]` throwing `OverflowException` on an enum with a negative member and taking the Inspector down. The Odin drawer rendered such members as "None" and wrote that back ([#339](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/339)).
- Fix an interrupted `Serializer.WriteToJsonFile()` destroying the previous save. Every JSON file write now stages and swaps, and creates missing directories ([#319](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/319)).
- Fix a copied `PooledResource<T>` or `PooledArray<T>` returning the same instance to the pool twice, so two live rentals shared one buffer. Every disposable scope in the package is now disposed at most once, at no allocation cost ([#358](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/358)).
- Fix a double-disposed `AssetDatabaseBatchScope` ending an outer scope's batch early, leaving the rest of its asset writes unbatched ([#358](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/358)).
- Fix copies of a `SemaphoreLease` each releasing the permit, which could raise the count and admit a second caller to a section built for one ([#358](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/358)).
- Fix `WallstopArrayPool<T>` and `WallstopFastArrayPool<T>` allocating 32 bytes on every rent ([#367](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/367)).
- Fix a rectangular-array header stating a huge dimension beside a zero one crashing a WallstopProto read with `OutOfMemoryException` ([#437](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/437)).
- Fix a value held as its base type never taking the WallstopProto path, so all seventeen random generators still went through protobuf-net, which does not work under IL2CPP ([#403](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/403)).
- Fix `ProtoSerialize(input, ref buffer)` and `ProtoDeserialize<T>(data, Type)` going straight to protobuf-net even for a ported contract ([#403](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/403)).
- Fix `forceRuntimeType: true` sending a ported contract to protobuf-net; runtime-type dispatch is exactly what a generated formatter does ([#403](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/403)).
- Fix a WallstopProto subtype serialized as itself writing only the members it declares, so the payload read back with its fields landing in the base's — no error, wrong values ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Fix a closed generic used only as `new Box<int>()` getting no formatter, which threw `InvalidOperationException` on first serialization in a built player ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Fix a generic contract closed from another assembly getting no formatter, which is the case the generator exists for. Your assembly now registers every closure it names ([#394](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/394)).
- Fix a WallstopProto contract with a `struct` dictionary member breaking your build with a null check and `??` emitted for a value type ([#388](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/388)).
- Fix `CS0136` in generated source for an immutable contract with a dictionary member ([#395](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/395)).
- Fix empty string map values written by protobuf-net v2 reading back as `null`, so old persisted maps migrate without changing their values ([#371](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/371)).
- Fix `SkipConstructor` leaving field-initializer collection contents ahead of decoded values, which changed the restored state of `PhotonSpinRandom` and `StormDropRandom`.
- Fix a nested generic closure throwing when an inner formatter declines; the outer contract now falls back to protobuf-net before writing anything ([#416](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/416)).
- Fix a replaced formatter being ignored: a late registration now invalidates `WProtoGeneric<T>`'s prior resolution instead of using the stale one.
- Fix WallstopProto formatters needing a manual `RegisterAll()`; the ones this package ships now register themselves as Unity starts. Your own registrations still override them ([#379](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/379)).
- Fix a hand-written formatter sidestepping the nesting bound by building a reader over sub-message bytes, which restarted the depth count. Use `WProtoReader.TryReadMessage(formatter, out value)`, or `new WProtoReader(payload, in parent)` to carry the parent's depth ([#377](https://github.com/Ambiguous-Interactive/unity-helpers/issues/377)).

## [3.5.1] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- **Unity license lock handoff after CI cleanup**: final Unity license returns now emit fail-closed cleanup proof to the organization build lock. Cleanup is bounded and non-masking, failed or cancelled acquisitions still release queued/owned lock state, and only a successful return command or exact allowlisted Unity responses permit the activation slot to enter cooldown instead of quarantine.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Asset change detection loop reset utility**: Added `AssetChangeDetectionUtility.ResetLoopProtection()` so editor tooling can resume `[DetectAssetChanged]` dispatch after a recursive callback has tripped loop protection, without requiring a domain reload.
- **Feel-good randomness helpers**: Added `ExactAveragePrd`, `BadLuckProtection`, and `WeightedShuffleBag<T>` for player-facing randomness that reduces streak frustration while keeping deterministic, testable behavior. `ExactAveragePrd` solves the pseudo-random distribution coefficient for a configured long-run average, `BadLuckProtection` implements pity-timer chance ramps and optional hard guarantees, and `WeightedShuffleBag<T>` emits exact weighted ticket counts before repeating. The helpers expose explicit restore APIs so save/load systems can persist pity/deck state.

### Fixed

- **Optional Odin Inspector integration without unguarded Odin assemblies**: `RuntimeSingleton<T>`, `ScriptableObjectSingleton<T>`, and `AttributeEffect` now use Odin serialized base classes only when the `odininspector` package is installed and the package-owned `WALLSTOP_UNITY_HELPERS_ODIN_INSPECTOR` define is active; otherwise they fall back to Unity base classes. Projects that still define the global `ODIN_INSPECTOR` symbol without shipping Sirenix assemblies no longer fail package compilation, while Odin projects keep the serialized base behavior automatically.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-07-01

See [the roadmap](./docs/overview/roadmap.md) for details

### Added

- **`AssetDatabaseBatchHelper.EnsureAssetFolder` / `EnsureAssetParentFolder`**: batch-safe helpers that register every missing folder segment with the `AssetDatabase` (never via raw disk, which can leave the database out of sync and spawn numbered duplicate folders) and pause any open `StartAssetEditing` batch first, so a subsequent `AssetDatabase.CreateAsset` cannot fail with "Parent directory must exist".

### Changed

- **`[WValueDropDown]` provider-misconfiguration is now logged as a Warning, not an Error**: a null/empty/missing/throwing or wrong-return-type dropdown value provider is a handled condition — the dropdown falls back to an empty option list — so `WValueDropDownAttribute` / `DropDownValueProvider` now log these diagnostics at `Warning` severity instead of `Error`. The message text is unchanged. This better reflects that the feature degrades gracefully, and (as a side effect) stops these editor-tooling diagnostics from failing PlayMode tests that incidentally exercise the dropdown path.
- **`DirectoryHelper.EnsureDirectoryExists` no longer logs an error before throwing**: passing a path outside `Assets/` in the editor previously emitted a `Debug.LogError` **and** threw an `ArgumentException` (a redundant double signal that polluted the console and could fail unrelated tests that did not expect the log). It now throws the `ArgumentException` only, and the exception message names the offending path (for example, `Cannot create directory 'SomeFolder/SubFolder' outside the Assets folder: AssetDatabase only manages paths under 'Assets/'.`). Callers that already catch the exception are unaffected; callers that relied on the console log should read the thrown exception instead.

### Fixed

- **Unity 6000.3 compatibility for runtime helpers**: `Object.GetUnityObjectId`, `UnityObjectExtensions.FindObjectsOfTypeShim`, `SceneHelper.EnsureOneComponent`, and the `Rigidbody2D` velocity helpers now gate Unity 6 APIs by the specific version that introduced them instead of treating every Unity 6000.x editor as equivalent. Unity 6000.3 and earlier supported matrix versions compile through the older overloads while Unity 6000.4+ continues to use the newer no-sort object lookup and `EntityId.ToULong` paths.
- **`EffectHandler` periodic catch-up after a long frame**: missed periodic ticks now advance on their scheduled interval instead of sliding from the current frame, and unlimited periodic effects are capped per update so a large frame hitch cannot monopolize the player loop. Remaining due ticks continue catching up on subsequent updates.
- **Protobuf abstract-root deserialization reporting corrupt data instead of a registration error**: abstract `[ProtoContract]` roots without `[ProtoInclude]` metadata now require an explicit `RegisterProtobufRoot` mapping before deserialize, so ambiguous abstract roots fail with the documented type-resolution exception instead of falling through to protobuf-net's version-specific corrupt-data / constructor errors. Explicit registrations also take precedence over abstract root heuristics.
- **Background logging using a stale Unity main-thread capture**: `WallstopStudiosLogger` now shares `UnityMainThreadGuard`'s captured main-thread state, preventing background log calls from being misclassified after test/player lifecycle resets.
- **Protobuf serialization of an EMPTY `SerializableHashSet` / `SerializableSortedSet` / `SerializableDictionary` / `SerializableSortedDictionary` throwing `SerializationInputException` ("data is empty") on deserialize**: an empty collection serializes to a zero-byte payload (the wrapper carries only repeated fields), but `ProtoDeserialize` ran its generic empty-payload guard before the collection-wrapper interception, so a valid empty collection could not round-trip. The collection interception now runs first, so an empty collection round-trips to an empty collection; the empty-payload guard still rejects empty input for ordinary (non-collection) message types. Wire format for non-empty payloads is unchanged.
- **Serialization crashing or silently corrupting data on IL2CPP/AOT standalone players**: `Serializer` now serializes the affected types through AOT-safe paths instead of protobuf-net's reflection / `Reflection.Emit` model, which under IL2CPP hit the unsupported `GetTypeModifiers` icall or bound immutable structs to empty values. `Deque<T>`, `CyclicBuffer<T>`, and `SparseSet` route through plain array/scalar protobuf wrappers (also fixing a spurious `[ProtoAfterDeserialization]` `ArgumentOutOfRangeException`); `FastVector2Int`, `FastVector3Int`, `ImmutableBitSet`, and `Parabola` route through mutable protobuf surrogates. `Serializer.JsonStringify` / `JsonSerialize` of anonymous types (and other types lacking a public parameterless constructor) now use a reflection-light writer instead of System.Text.Json's parameterized-constructor converter, which has no AOT code under IL2CPP. A package `link.xml` preserves the serialization assemblies. JSON output and protobuf round-trip values are unchanged on mono / editor. The package pre-registers the common element specializations (`int`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `bool`, `string`, `Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector2Int`, `Vector3Int`, `FastVector2Int`, `FastVector3Int`); consumers that store a **custom value-type** element in a `Deque<T>` or `CyclicBuffer<T>` must register that `T` for AOT themselves (reference-type elements share a single generic specialization and need no registration).
- **Relational component attributes (`[SiblingComponent]` / `[ChildComponent]` / `[ParentComponent]`) crashing or resolving the wrong components on IL2CPP/AOT players**: the collection fast-path built a runtime generic accessor via `Expression.Compile()`, which IL2CPP cannot service (it threw at runtime). It now uses the AOT-safe non-generic `GetComponents` / `GetComponentsInChildren` / `GetComponentsInParent(Type, …)` overloads. Include-inactive filtering also wrongly treated every component as enabled on IL2CPP (a reflection delegate path that silently failed), so disabled components were not filtered out; the enabled state is now read AOT-safely. Behavior on mono / editor is unchanged.
- **`[WNotNull]` validation (`this.CheckForNulls()`) silently doing nothing in player builds**: the null check was compiled only into the editor, so it never threw `ArgumentNullException` for a null `[WNotNull]` field in a built player. It now runs in every build (AOT-safe) exactly as the API documents, so missing required references fail fast at runtime instead of being silently ignored.
- **`[ValidateAssignment]` validation (`this.ValidateAssignments()`) silently doing nothing in player builds**: like `CheckForNulls`, the warning pass was compiled only into the editor (while the sibling `AreAnyAssignmentsInvalid` already ran everywhere), so unassigned fields were never reported in a built player. It now runs in every build (AOT-safe), consistent with `AreAnyAssignmentsInvalid`.
- **`ScriptableObjectSingleton` assets not regenerating on Unity 6 after the asset file was deleted**: when a singleton's `.asset` was removed but its `.meta` remained, Unity 6000.3+ retains the path-to-GUID mapping, which `ScriptableObjectSingletonCreator` treated as "path already occupied" and skipped recreation. Creation decisions now key on the asset body file, so the singleton is recreated on every Unity version.
- **`AssetDatabase.CreateAsset` failing with "Parent directory must exist" / "Creating asset at path … failed"**: editor utilities that create assets — `ScriptableObjectSingletonCreator`, `ScriptableObjectSingletonMetadataUtility`, `AttributeMetadataCacheGenerator`, `PersistentDirectorySettings`, and the sprite/atlas/animation creator windows — now ensure the parent folder is registered with the `AssetDatabase` before creating the asset, including while an `AssetDatabase` batch is open (common under `-batchmode`). Previously, creating an asset in a not-yet-registered folder could fail or be skipped.
- **Unity 6 deprecation warnings from `Object.FindObjectsOfType` / `FindObjectOfType`**: runtime DI-integration code (Reflex / VContainer / Zenject) now routes object lookups through a version-gated shim that uses `FindObjectsByType` / `FindFirstObjectByType` on Unity 2022.2+ (including Unity 6) and the legacy API below it, eliminating the deprecation warnings while preserving behavior.
- **`MonoBehaviour.ExecuteFunctionAfterFrame` callback never firing in headless/batch mode**: the helper yielded `WaitForEndOfFrame`, which never resumes under `-batchmode -nographics` (no end-of-frame render signal), so the queued callback was silently dropped on headless players, dedicated servers, and CI. It now advances a single frame in batch mode (the headless-safe equivalent) and continues to use `WaitForEndOfFrame` in interactive/graphical sessions, so the callback runs in every environment.

## [3.3.0]

### Added

- **Failed Tests Exporter**: New editor utility that hooks into the Unity Test Runner to automatically capture test failures and export them to timestamped text files
  - Automatically records test name, failure message, and stack trace for each failed test
  - Configurable output directory with a visual folder picker — defaults to the project root if not set
  - Path validation on every use: falls back to the project root if the configured directory is missing, invalid, or outside the project
  - Menu items under `Tools > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers` to export or clear captured failures
  - Disabled by default — enable via `Project Settings > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers`

### Fixed

- **Editor asset import-loop pressure from unchanged metadata saves**: `ScriptableObjectSingletonMetadata` and `AttributeMetadataCache` now skip `SetDirty` / `SaveAssets` work when regenerated metadata is unchanged. This prevents initialize-on-load and explicit singleton ensure passes from repeatedly re-saving identical assets during Unity test runs or editor refreshes, reducing the chance of Unity's "infinite import loop" detector tripping on native runs.
- **`AssetPostprocessorDeferral` dedup regressing structurally-equal-but-distinct drains**: `AssetPostprocessorDeferral.Schedule` now dedups pending drains via `ReferenceEquals` instead of `List<Action>.Contains` (which invokes `Delegate.Equals`). The prior structural-equality behavior silently coalesced two distinct delegates that shared the same `Method`+`Target` -- common when a local helper returns a lambda that captures only outer-method variables -- so a self-rescheduling drain could be dropped entirely. Matches the documented intent in the [AssetPostprocessor safety skill](./.llm/skills/asset-postprocessor-safety.md) and is pinned by the new `ScheduleStructurallyEqualButDistinctDelegatesAreNotDeduplicated` regression test
- **WButton conflict warnings hidden in collapsed foldouts**: Fixed group conflict warnings (placement, priority, and draw order) not rendering when foldout groups are collapsed. Conflict warnings now render in the group header area regardless of foldout expansion state, and warning cache population is validated across collapsed, expanded, and always-open foldout behavior.
- **Spurious "SendMessage cannot be called..." warnings from asset processors**: Eliminated spurious "SendMessage cannot be called during Awake, CheckConsistency, or OnValidate" warnings from `DetectAssetChangeProcessor` and related editor processors (`LlmArtifactCleaner`, `SpriteLabelProcessor`) by deferring callback invocation out of Unity's asset-import phase via a shared `AssetPostprocessorDeferral` helper backed by `EditorApplication.delayCall`. The prior synchronous path called `AssetDatabase.LoadAllAssetsAtPath` / `GetComponentsInChildren` / user callbacks during the import phase, which triggered Unity's internal sprite/renderer lifecycle relays and produced per-import warning storms. A new opt-out setting (`Project Settings > Wallstop Studios > Unity Helpers > Detect Asset Changes`, option **Defer Post-process Callbacks**, default on) restores the old synchronous behavior for users who require it. ([#234](https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers/pull/234))
- **Pool auto-purge throttle dropping real purges**: Fixed `WallstopGenericPool<T>.PurgeInternalCore` letting the 1-second `MinAutoPurgeIntervalSeconds` throttle block `MaxPoolSize` enforcement. A Rent/Return that advanced `_lastAutoPurgeTime` on a healthy-pool scan would block a subsequent same-tick call that pushed the pool past `MaxPoolSize`, silently skipping the `CapacityExceeded` purge and dropping the matching `OnPurge` notification. The throttle now has two orthogonal rules: (1) when the pool is observably over `MaxPoolSize`, the throttle is bypassed entirely so a burst of returns cannot accumulate beyond capacity within a single clock tick; (2) otherwise the throttle still rate-limits scans (preserving the O(1) amortized fast path for healthy pools under contention). The multithreaded variant also guards the timestamp advance with CAS max-semantics so concurrent out-of-order writes cannot regress the throttle clock. Applies to both the multithreaded and SINGLE_THREADED pool variants
- **Pool performance regression from O(n) usage tracking**: Fixed `RollingHighWaterMark` (used by pool purge system) performing O(n) operations on every pool rent/return, causing 100x slowdowns under sustained load. Replaced `List<Sample>` with `CyclicBuffer<Sample>` for O(1) add/remove, added incremental running sum for O(1) average computation, and added a monotonic deque for O(1) amortized peak tracking. Previously, 100K rent/return cycles took 20+ seconds; now completes within 200ms budget
- **TexturePlatformOverrideEntryDrawer render-phase mutations**: Fixed `OnGUI` writing to `SerializedProperty` values every frame without `BeginChangeCheck`/`EndChangeCheck` guards. Direct assignments like `apply.boolValue = EditorGUI.ToggleLeft(...)` and `nameProp.stringValue = EditorGUI.TextField(...)` dirtied the `SerializedObject` on every repaint, corrupting undo history. Also removed a redundant render-phase writeback of the computed display label to the platform name property
- **TexturePlatformOverrideEntryDrawer GenericMenu undo and Custom handling**: Fixed `GenericMenu` callback not calling `Undo.RecordObjects` before mutation and not handling the "Custom" menu option. Selecting "Custom" from the dropdown now correctly sets the platform name to `string.Empty` (triggering custom mode), and all selections are undoable
- **SourceFolderEntryDrawer render-phase mutation**: Fixed `EnumFlagsField` for selection mode writing to `modeProp.intValue` every frame without a `BeginChangeCheck`/`EndChangeCheck` guard
- **AttributeMetadataCache generator path mismatch**: Fixed `AttributeMetadataCacheGenerator.GetOrCreateCache()` using hardcoded asset paths that did not match the `[ScriptableSingletonPath("Wallstop Studios/Unity Helpers")]` attribute on `AttributeMetadataCache`. The generator was creating and loading the cache asset from `Assets/Resources/Wallstop Studios/` instead of the correct `Assets/Resources/Wallstop Studios/Unity Helpers/` path, causing cache generation to silently fail when the singleton was already loaded at the correct path
- **IntDropDown invalid value handling**: Fixed `IntDropDownDrawer` to properly handle property values that fall outside the configured options. Invalid values (values not in the options array) are now preserved without modification during render and clearly displayed with an "(Invalid)" suffix. Previously, invalid values were displayed as-is without any visual indication. The UI Toolkit `IntDropDownSelector.GetDefaultValue()` now returns the first option instead of 0
- **Linux dropdown rendering phantom rows**: Replaced all `EditorGUI.Popup` usage with `GenericMenu`-based dropdowns to eliminate phantom empty rows when selected index is -1 on Linux. Affected drawers: `WValueDropDownDrawer`, `IntDropDownDrawer`, `StringInListDrawer`, `TexturePlatformOverrideEntryDrawer` (standard variants), and `WValueDropDownOdinDrawer`, `IntDropDownOdinDrawer`, `StringInListOdinDrawer` (Odin Inspector variants). Odin drawers now always use `GenericMenu` regardless of the page limit setting, since `GenericMenu` handles all list sizes correctly without the rendering issues that required the threshold ([#209](https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers/pull/209))
- **Multi-object editing for WValueDropDown**: Added typed `SerializedProperty` setters for Unity-native types (`Vector2`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`, `Color`, `Rect`, `Bounds`, `Quaternion`, `AnimationCurve`, `Hash128`, and their `Int` variants) in `WValueDropDownDrawer.ApplyOption` to avoid the reflection fallback for known property types. The generic reflection path now iterates over all `serializedObject.targetObjects` for proper multi-object editing support instead of only updating the first selected object
- **SerializableSet undo not working for add, clear, sort, and commit operations**: Fixed `TryClearSet`, `TryAddNewElement`, `TryCommitPendingEntry`, `AppendNullPlaceholderEntry`, and `TrySortElements` in `SerializableSetPropertyDrawer` not calling `Undo.FlushUndoRecordObjects()` after direct object mutation. These methods used `Undo.RecordObjects` to snapshot pre-change state but never finalized the undo record, causing `Undo.PerformUndo()` to silently do nothing
- **GUIContent GC pressure in drawer OnGUI**: Fixed per-frame `GUIContent` allocations in `IntDropDownDrawer.DrawGenericMenuDropDown` and `PoolTypeConfigurationDrawer.OnGUI` that created avoidable garbage collection pressure in the Inspector. Both drawers now reuse static `GUIContent` instances (consistent with `WValueDropDownDrawer` and `StringInListDrawer` which already followed this pattern)

## [3.2.1]

### Fixed

- **WValueDropDown empty rows in dropdown**: Fixed `WValueDropDown` and `StringInList` dropdowns showing empty/blank rows at the top of the dropdown list, particularly on Linux. Clamped invalid `-1` selected indices to `0` in `WValueDropDownDrawer` and `StringInListDrawer`, and hardened dropdown display logic to replace empty labels with descriptive fallback text ([#209](https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers/pull/209))
- **Dropdown display label normalization**: Fixed search, filter, suggestion, and selected-value display in `WValueDropDown`, `StringInList`, and popup dropdown windows not applying the `(Option N)` fallback label consistently, causing items with empty display labels to be unsearchable and the wrong option to appear selected ([#213](https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers/pull/213))

## [3.1.9]

### Fixes

- "Destroying assets is not permitted to avoid data loss" on Asset Domain Reload issue

## [3.1.8]

### Fixed

- **Unity 6.3 unsigned package warning**: Added `"signature": "unsigned"` field to package.json to explicitly mark the package as unsigned for Unity 6.3+. This prevents Unity from showing a warning that the package is missing a signature. The change is backwards compatible with older Unity versions and works with OpenUPM, npm, and git URL installations.
- **WGroup not working in Unity 6000.x**: Fixed WGroup attributes not rendering in Unity 6 by using named parameter syntax for `CustomEditor` attribute's `editorForChildClasses` parameter. This change is backward compatible with Unity 2022 and earlier versions.

## [3.1.7]

- **DetectAssetChanged scene file crash**: Fixed Unity crash ("Do not use ReadObjectThreaded on scene objects!") when `.unity` or `.scenetemplate` files were processed by the asset change detection system

## [3.1.6]

### Fixed

- **Banner SVG Issues**: Various issues relating to Unity Helpers banner SVG rendering
- **Documentation nested list rendering**: Fixed GitHub Pages rendering where nested bullet lists appeared flat without proper indentation ([#175](https://github.com/wallstop/unity-helpers/pull/175))
- **Documentation too self-congratulatory**: Toned down the documentation to be more realistic and less LLM-speak

## [3.1.5]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** Relational component attributes (`[SiblingComponent]`, `[ParentComponent]`, `[ChildComponent]`) now assign `null` to single-component fields when no matching component is found and `SkipIfAssigned=false` (the default). Previously, fields retained their existing values when no component was found. This change makes single-field behavior consistent with collection-field behavior, which already assigned empty collections.

## [3.1.4]

### Added

- **ScriptableObjectSingletonMetadata Sync Button**: Added a `Sync` button to `ScriptableObjectSingletonMetadata` inspector that re-scans all assemblies for `ScriptableObjectSingleton<T>` types and updates their metadata entries. This allows manually refreshing singleton metadata when assets are added, moved, or renamed.

### Fixed

- **ScriptableObjectSingletonCreator race condition**: Fixed issue where newly created singleton assets were immediately deleted because `LoadAssetAtPath` returned null before Unity's AssetDatabase had indexed the file. The fix adds a synchronous import after `CreateAsset` and avoids deleting on-disk files when the file exists but isn't visible to the AssetDatabase yet.

## [3.1.3]

### Added

- **AnimationCreator Configuration Persistence**: Save and load AnimationCreator settings to JSON files alongside sprite source folders.
  - Configurations are automatically saved as `.animation-creator.json` in sprite source directories
  - Auto-loads existing configurations when source folders are selected
  - Save individual or all configurations with dedicated UI buttons
  - Reset to defaults with optional config file deletion
  - Preserves all settings including animation data, framerate curves, regex patterns, and grouping options
- **AnimationCreator Pagination**: Animation data list now uses pagination (20 items per page) for better performance with large animation sets

### Fixed

- **AnimationCreator editor performance**: Significantly improved scrolling and editing responsiveness when working with animation data.
- **ScriptableObjectSingletonCreator retry exhaustion**: Fixed issue where new singleton assets would fail to create with "Maximum automatic retry attempts reached" even when specifying paths.
- **Animation Copier diff detection**: Fixed issue where copied animations were incorrectly detected as "changed" instead of "unchanged" after copy operations.

## [3.1.2]

### Fixed

- Updated npmignore to align more closely with gitignore. The `scripts/tests` meta file error when sourcing from npm should be gone.

## [3.1.1]

### Fixed

- WInLineEditorOdinDrawer now compiles.

## [3.1.0]

  - Configurable via `PoolPurgeSettings.PurgeOnLowMemory` and `PoolPurgeSettings.PurgeOnAppBackground`
  - `GlobalPoolRegistry` tracks all pool instances for cross-pool operations
  - `PoolPurgeSettings.PurgeAllPools()` method for manual global purge
  - Lifecycle hooks automatically registered via `RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod`
- **RandomExtensions `NextOfExcept`**: New extension methods for selecting random elements with exclusions
  - `NextOfExcept(values)` - no exclusions (convenience overload)
  - `NextOfExcept(values, exception1...)` - exclude values
  - Zero-allocation using pooled collections internally

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Pool purging now enabled by default with conservative settings
  - `GlobalEnabled` defaults to `true` (was `false`)
  - `DefaultBufferMultiplier` defaults to `2.0` (was `1.5`)
  - `DefaultHysteresisSeconds` defaults to `120` (was `60`)

  - Use `PoolPurgeSettings.DisableGlobally()` to restore previous behavior
  - `UnityMainThreadDispatcher` auto-load behavior has changed from auto-loading to not auto-loading.
  - `UnityMainThreadDispatcher` hide flags have been changed to `None`.

- **DictionaryExtensions `ToDictionary`**: Now uses last-wins semantics for duplicate keys instead of throwing `ArgumentException`
  - Aligns with common dictionary initialization patterns
  - Applies to both `KeyValuePair<K,V>` and tuple `(K, V)` overloads

- **IEnumerableExtensions return types**: `OrderBy`, `Ordered`, and `Shuffled` methods now return `List<T>` instead of `IEnumerable<T>` for improved usability (indexable, known count)
  - **Note**: These methods now use eager evaluation (execute immediately) instead of deferred evaluation
  - Source code remains compatible—`List<T>` is assignable to `IEnumerable<T>`

### Improved

- **LRU cache eviction**: Bounded editor caches now use LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction instead of FIFO
  - Frequently-accessed cache entries are retained longer, improving cache hit rates
  - Both reads and writes update an item's "recency", preventing hot items from being evicted
  - Affects `EditorCacheHelper.AddToBoundedCache` and new `TryGetFromBoundedLRUCache` method
  - Applied to `InLineEditorShared`, `WShowIfPropertyDrawer`, and other bounded editor caches
- **Shuffled performance**: `IEnumerableExtensions.Shuffled` now uses O(n) Fisher-Yates shuffle instead of O(n log n) sort-based approach
- **LINQ elimination**: Removed LINQ usage across runtime code for reduced allocations and improved performance
  - Affects `Trie`, `Geometry`, `Serializer`, `ValidateAssignmentAttribute`, `WShowIfAttribute`, relational component attributes, and more
  - Uses pooled collections and explicit loops instead of LINQ methods
  - Zero-allocation patterns applied throughout
- **GlobalPoolRegistry.EnforceBudget() zero-allocation**: Replaced per-call `List<IPoolStatistics>` allocation with static reusable list protected by existing lock

### Fixed

- **Cache pre-allocation OutOfMemoryException**: Fixed production bug where `Cache<TKey, TValue>` would pre-allocate internal storage to `MaximumSize` instead of using a small initial capacity
  - Creating a cache with `MaximumSize = int.MaxValue` now works correctly instead of throwing `OutOfMemoryException`
  - New `InitialCapacity` option allows explicit control over starting allocation size (default 16)
  - Cache grows dynamically from `InitialCapacity` toward `MaximumSize` as items are added
  - `CacheBuilder<TKey, TValue>.InitialCapacity(int)` method for fluent configuration
  - `Cache<TKey, TValue>.MaximumSize` property added to expose configured maximum (distinct from `Capacity`)
  - Large `InitialCapacity` values are clamped to `MaxReasonableInitialCapacity` (65536) to prevent excessive allocations
- **Pool MinRetainCount not respected during gradual explicit purges**: Fixed `MinRetainCount` being ignored when using `MaxPurgesPerOperation` with explicit purges
  - Gradual purges now correctly stop when pool size reaches `MinRetainCount`
  - Added `_pool.Count > effectiveMinRetain` check to the purge loop condition in both thread-safe and non-thread-safe pool implementations
- **Pool idle timeout purges blocked by comfortable size**: Fixed idle timeout purges not occurring when pool size was at or below comfortable size
  - Idle timeout purges now proceed regardless of comfortable size, as they represent essential pool hygiene
  - Added `hasIdleTimeout` to loop entry condition to allow idle timeout evaluation independent of size
- **Pool hysteresis incorrectly blocking idle timeout purges**: Fixed hysteresis protection blocking all purge types including idle timeout
  - Idle timeout purges now proceed during hysteresis since they only remove items unused for extended periods
  - Capacity and explicit purges remain blocked during hysteresis to prevent thrashing
- **ScriptableObjectSingletonCreator race condition creating numbered duplicate folders**: Fixed race condition where parallel operations could cause Unity to create numbered duplicate folders like "Resources 1", "Resources 2", etc.
  - Added detection for Unity's numbered duplicate folder creation pattern
  - Automatically deletes duplicate folders and uses the intended folder path
  - Logs warning if duplicate folder deletion fails, alerting user to manual cleanup needed

  - Provides simple API for any custom editor to draw WButton methods
  - Methods: `DrawButtonsAtTop()`, `DrawButtonsAtBottom()`, `ProcessInvocations()`, and convenience methods
  - Documented integration patterns for both Odin Inspector and standard Unity custom editors

### Fixed

- **Sprite Sheet Auto-Detection Preferring Non-Transparent Boundaries**: Fixed an issue where the "Auto Best" algorithm and other detection methods could select grid boundaries that pass through non-transparent pixels when transparent alternatives existed
  - Changed scoring system from linear to non-linear, heavily favoring fully transparent grid lines (10x higher score) over partially transparent ones
  - Adjusted boundary comparison to only prefer alternatives when transparency score differs by more than 5%, preventing minor variations from overriding better transparent boundaries
  - When scores are similar, the algorithm now prefers divisors closer to the originally detected cell size
  - This fix affects `ScoreDivisorByTransparency`, `ScoreCellSizeForDimension`, and `FindBestTransparencyAlignedDivisor` methods
- **Manual Recompile Silent Failure After Build**: Fixed an issue where the "Request Script Recompilation" menu item and shortcut would stop responding after building a project (particularly on Linux)
  - Added defensive null check in compilation pending evaluator to prevent silent `NullReferenceException`
  - The null evaluator scenario could occur when static field initialization failed or was corrupted during build operations without a domain reload

  - `ValidateAssignmentAttribute` new constructor overloads for easy customization of message type and custom messages
  - New `ValidateAssignmentPropertyDrawer` for rendering validation feedback in the inspector
  - Both attributes maintain full backward compatibility—existing code works unchanged with default warning messages
  - `StringInListAttribute` now supports `[StringInList(nameof(Method))]` to call parameterless instance or static methods on the decorated object, and the drawer exposes the same experience in both IMGUI and UI Toolkit inspectors
  - `WButton` now supports `groupPriority` and `groupPlacement` parameters for fine-grained control over button group ordering and positioning

  - The "Request Script Compilation" utility includes a Unity Shortcut Manager binding (default **Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + R**) for quick access. The shortcut appears under _Wallstop Studios / Request Script Compilation_ and can be remapped like any other Unity shortcut.
  - Coroutine wait buffer defaults can now be configured under **Project Settings ▸ Wallstop Studios ▸ Unity Helpers**. The generated `Resources/WallstopStudios/UnityHelpers/UnityHelpersBufferSettings.asset` applies the selected quantization, entry caps, and LRU mode automatically on domain reload or when the player starts (unless your code overrides the values at runtime).
  - Added **Unity Method Analyzer** (`Tools ▸ Wallstop Studios ▸ Unity Helpers ▸ Unity Method Analyzer`) for detecting inheritance issues and Unity lifecycle method errors across C# codebases
- **Random Number Generation**: Extended PRNG capabilities
  - Added `BlastCircuitRandom` and `WaveSplatRandom` generators with improved performance characteristics
  - New `RandomGeneratorMetadata` system for inspecting generator properties
  - Extended random sampling methods with improved statistical distribution
- **Array Pooling**: New `SystemArrayPool<T>` and unified `PooledArray<T>` return type
  - Added `SystemArrayPool<T>` wrapping `System.Buffers.ArrayPool<T>.Shared` for variable-sized allocations

  - Critical for `SystemArrayPool<T>`: returned arrays may be larger than requested; always use `pooled.Length`, not `array.Length`
- **Grid Concave Hull Reliability**:
  - Edge-split and grid KNN hull builders now insert missing axis-aligned corners after the initial pass, guaranteeing concave stair, horseshoe, and serpentine inputs retain their interior vertices even when only sparse samples exist.
  - Improved handling of staircase patterns, axis-corner preservation, and diagonal-only rejection for more robust hull generation.

### Fixed

- **Geometry & Spatial**: Convex hull computation
  - Fixed convex hull behavior for edge cases (collinear points, degenerate cases)
  - Improved hull computation accuracy and performance
- **GUID Generation**: Specification compliance
  - Fixed GUID v4 generation to properly set version and variant bits per RFC 4122
- **Editor Settings**: Project settings and drawer issues
  - Fixed obsolete API usage in editor code
  - Fixed project settings panel rendering issues
  - Fixed reflection-based property access for better performance
- **Scriptable Object Singletons**: Duplicate folders should no longer be created
  - Fixed a "should-never-happen" bug where, if a singleton was accessed for the first time off the main thread, it would never be able to be accessed for the lifetime of the process
  - Fixed a bug where auto-creation would happen concurrently with AssetDatabase importing, resulting in Unity crashing with no error message

### Improved

- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Reduced reflection usage in custom property drawers (10-100x faster in some cases)
  - Optimized list navigation and caching for large collections
  - Faster indexing and lookup in serializable data structures
  - Improved drawer update performance for complex inspector hierarchies
  - Data structure conversion optimizations
  - Minor relational component performance improvements, specifically for children components
  - Reduced GC allocations across property drawers, editor tools, and various helpers
- **EnhancedImage Visual Component**:
  - Improved material instance management with proper cleanup OnDestroy
  - Better domain reload handling for HDR color and material state persistence
  - Enhanced editor inspector with automatic material fix suggestions
- **Animation Editor Tools**:
  - Fixed FPS field handling in Animation Viewer and Sprite Sheet Animation Creator
  - Improved frame reordering and preview responsiveness
- **Documentation**:
  - Major documentation refactor for clarity
  - Added GUID generation documentation
  - Improved inline code documentation
  - Better attribute usage examples

### Changed

- **Breaking Changes**:
  - Removed `KVector2` (deprecated, use Unity's built-in Vector2)
  - Renamed `KGuid` -> `WGuid`, changed data layout
  - Forced `WallstopFastArrayPool` to force `unmanaged` types. This pool does not clear arrays and can leak references.
  - `WallstopArrayPool<T>` and `WallstopFastArrayPool<T>` now return `PooledArray<T>` instead of `PooledResource<T[]>`. Update usages from `pooled.resource` to `pooled.Array` and consider using `pooled.Length` for iteration bounds.
  - The legacy line-division concave hull overload `BuildConcaveHull(IEnumerable<FastVector3Int>, Grid, float scaleFactor, float concavity)` has been marked `[Obsolete]` and now throws `NotSupportedException`. Use `ConcaveHullStrategy.Knn` or `ConcaveHullStrategy.EdgeSplit` (and their dedicated helpers) instead; the docs now call out this retirement explicitly.
  - `StringInList` inspectors now keep the property row single-line and open a dedicated popup that contains search, pagination, and keyboard navigation for large catalogs (applies to both IMGUI and UI Toolkit drawers, including `SerializableType`).
- **API Improvements**:
  - Simplified `TryAdd` methods for collections
  - Enforced `IComparable` constraint where appropriate for sorting
  - Better handling of null additions in collections
  - Updated editor tooling for better integration with Unity 2021.3+
  - Default IList.Sort to Grail sort for stability and improved performance
- **Documentation**:
  - Updated documentation to reflect new features and API changes
  - Re-organized documentation into a more logical structure
  - Consolidated documentation naming around kebab-case
