# Test Script: License year resolution across a staged rename
# =============================================================================
# Regression coverage for issue #668, where the license-year fixer and the
# license-year audit disagreed about a renamed file.
#
# `git log --follow` reads committed history and never consults the index, so a
# STAGED rename (`git mv old.cs new.cs`) produced no creation year for the new
# path. scripts/update-license-headers.sh fell back to the current year and
# rewrote the header; scripts/audit-license-years.sh asked the identical
# question in --paths mode, got the identical empty answer, and agreed. The
# disagreement only surfaced after the rename was committed, when the audit's
# repository-wide scan followed the `R` status back to the original year and
# reddened CI.
#
# The non-rename case always passed, and that is exactly what hid the defect, so
# every leg below is about a rename. Two negative legs keep the fix honest: a
# genuinely new file must still resolve to the current year.
#
# All git work happens in a throwaway repository under `mktemp -d`. This test
# must never touch the checkout it lives in.
#
# Run: bash scripts/tests/test-license-year-rename.sh
# Exit codes: 0 = all tests pass, 1 = test failure
